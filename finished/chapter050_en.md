# Chapter 50: A Story of Dragons, Founders, and Champions

Neville was following Hermione.

Unsurprisingly, the young girl had gone through the Fat Lady's protrait, who was guarding the entrance to their Common Room, and was now climbing down the stairs of Gryffindor tower.

The sudden warmth of the Galleon told him that everyone had woken up and had responded.
The Longbottom heir sighed in relief.
Without waiting futher, he took the small gold coin in his hand.

«In the Entry Hall in five minutes!» Neville declared, urgency perceptible in his voice, even through telepathy.

Several replies came back, reassuring him.
THey would all be there, even Mary-Ann, who had just been pushed into hte magical world.
The Entwhistles were definitely something elese, because despite her brother's recommendations, Pap did not want to hear any contradiction.
She was now part of the Alliance, so she would come.

"Neville!"

The Gryffindor turned, wand raised and ready to cast a painful hex, when he recognised the two identical redheads.
The twins, still in long johns, had just ran of their own dormitory.
They joined him, panting.

"What…"

"… is happening?" Fred added.

"Hermione is either possessed, a sleepwalking, in a transe, or worse, under the _Imperius_ curse.
because she never seemed subject to such a sleeping disorder, I think it's one of the other ones."

"Not good," Fred grumbled, looking at the brown hair disappearing in the stairs.

"According to the Defence Professor, we can't do much without risking her mental health," George mumbled back.
"However, if it's the _Imperius_, a quite powerful _Finite Incantatem_ should do the trick.
Have you tried that?"

"No, I didn't know," Neville groaned.

The Gryffindor hurried to go past the young woman and warn every one.
He absolutely wanted to avoid any bad surprise if they suddenly saw each other in the Entry Hall.
He also cast the most common counterspell in the magical world at the same time.

Nothing changed.
Hermione, still staring into the void, continued walking without realizing that Neville was in front of her.
He stepped aside so they did not hit each other.

"Fred, George, go down the hall.
Tell the others that Hermione is possessed or in a trance.
Prevent them from screaming."

The twins nodded and ran to the lower level.
Neville had had a good idea, because the three Ravenclaws were already there, along with their favourite Potions Master.

"What is happening?" Severus asked in a silky smooth voice full of danger, raising a mocking eyebrow at the twins' outfits.

"Hermione is either possessed…"

"… or in a trance," George panted.

Vladmir pinched the bridge of his nose while sighing when Cedric ran up like a mandman from the basement, wand in hand.

"What…"

"Mister Diggory!
If you had crossed path with my colleagues or the caretaker, how could you have justified your aggression?
Mister and Mister Weasley, do you have an explanation for your… minimalistic outfits?"

The three students blushed and the twins arranged their outfits with a flick of their wands.
At that moment, Hermione arrived in the Hall, followed by Neville.

All looked slack-jawed at the young with only wearing her nightshirt, walking bearfoot around them and going to the Dungeons.

"She is not possessed," Severus declared slowly.
"She must be in a trance, but why…"

"Luna thinks she will see a dragon.
She said exactly 'Hermione will meet a dragon'."

"_This_ dragon?" the Potions Master grew pale as he looked at Luna, who gave him a delighted smile in response, her eyes shining with joy.

"What dragon?" Kevin wondered.
Severus stayed silent, lost in his thoughts.
However, his face showed his worry and reflected his dark thoughts enough.
The Alliance understood the real danger when the Potions Master and _Underground_ Triad summoned a Patronus.

"Tell the Headmistress is in a trance and is probably going to the Crypt," Severus whispered to the beautiful doe taht appeared.
"Have her activate the school's protection quarters to their maximum."

"Severus?"

"Later," the Potions Master whispered with a sombre face that dissuaded any further question.
Professor Prince advised them to stay attentive and to keep their wands in hand.

The conversation had not taken more than five minutes, and they were thus increasingly worried as they rushed behind the young woman.
She was slightly ahead of them and they walked into the dark and damp basements of Hogwarts.

"What is going on with Hermione," Draco suddenly asked, his face serious, as they reached the first basement housing the entrance to the Hufflepuff Common Room and the home of the Slytherins.

"Yeah, she was weird and even ignored us!" Mary-Ann protested next to Draco, crossing her arms.
Her pout was amusing, especially when taking into account the thick layer of bright pink paint on her hair and shoulders.
The two Slytherins had joined in their Common Room before going into the corridors.
They had the bad luck of meeting a certain pltergeist, which had slowed them down.

"We've met Peeves," Draco sighed, his sleeve the only painted part of his body.
"He let us go once we threatened Kevin would visit him."

Kevin gave him a vague smile while Severus was cleaning them.
His attention was focused on his sister…
Kevin hesitated, then, when his sister looked daggers at him, sighed.

"Stay right next to us, Pap.
If you don't obey one order, I'll make sure you spend the rest of the year in your Common Room."

"Thanks, big brother!" Mary-Ann laughed, kissing his cheek, beforefollowing the others and holding Luna's hand.

"She is leading you around by the nose," Neville chuckled.

"Yeah, as she does Draco and you," the Ravenclaw sighed.
"Only Vladmir can resister her…"

"You…" Neville hesitated.

"Even if I had forbidden it, she'd have come," Kevin mumbled, his blue eyes showing the fullness of his worry.
"I'd rather she was next to us and aware of the dangers."

"Severus, are you sure?" Vlad whispered, ahead with the Potions Master.

Hermione had ust turned into a corridor that was dusty and way darker than the rest.
They had explored this part of the castle the previous year, but it still made them uneasy.
The real Howgarts dungeons were far lower under the castle, far lower than the potions laboratories and the Slytherins' domain.

"Indeed.
I only hope that she is not leading us in the catacombs… no one has stepped foot in there for centuries and I am not sure it is safe," Severus whispered.

"The catacombs?" Vlad noted.
"You think she is leading us to the Founders' Crypt?"

"I pray Mother Magia that it is not the case."

Vladmir stopped for a few seconds to look at his professor.

"What is in the Crypt?" he asked slowly.

"The Founder's corpses."

"Don't try that with me Severus!" Vladmir said loudly, making the whole group stop.
"Luna talked about a dragon, and you were afraid!
What is the Crypt hiding?"

"Hogwarts," the wizard whispered.
"It houses Hogwarts."

"Wait, it houses the school's entity?" Neville sounded interested.

"No.
Hogwarts was the Founders' familiar.
An Icelandic purple drago," the man added.

"This breed has been extinct for centuries!" Cedric tried to deny.

"The last member is sleeping under the school," Severus sighed.
"It is the castle's ultimate defence."

At this moment, something shook the whole place, making dust fly up.
Luna was the only one to stay standing, the quake throwing every one else to the ground.
Runes engraved in the corridor's stones briefly glowing, before fading back to obscurity.

Seerus sighed in relief when the shaking stopped a few minutes later.
It probably went unnoticed in the castle, but not here.
They were in the castle's foundations, after all.

"What was that?" Luna whispered.

"Augusta triggering the school's powerful protections," the Potions Master declared.

"Why?"

"Honestly, if Hermione could unwittingly wake up a thousand-year-old dragon, I'd prefer the school ready to sustain a cataclysm," Neville whispered.

"He's not wrong," Draco agreed.

"Normally, Hogwarts will not harm the school, but you never know…
Listen to me," Severus continued slowly.
"The last time we were in this part of the castle, it was to go to the dungeons.
The catacombs are even lower and look out to the lake, at the same level as Sasssly's den.
It is humid, and it is possible that creatures have settled there.
Hermione should be safe thankgs to her Licorine blood.
It is not the case for us.
It is probable that the Founders' Crypt is protacted by spells.

"We would be better off with a Curse-Breaker," Vladmir sighed.
"The only one I know is William Weasley, but he works somewhere in Egypt…
Hermione would probably have a few spells in her mind, but…
Kevin?"

"No, sorry Vlad, Mione's the better ones in Charms."

"I can maybe help," Cedric smiled.
"I'd want to become a Curse-Breaker, and I have a good knowledge of protection spells."

"Stay in the middle then Cedric, if we get into trouble, don't intervene…
Good, let's get to Hermione," Severus sighed.

Fortunately, despite the labyrinth of basements, it was relatively easy to follow the traces of bare feet in the centuries-old dust.

And Severus became certain that Hermione was going to the Crypt when her steps led her to a new flight of stairs…
Under a heavy silence, the Alliance entered the catacombs.

Only their footsteps and breathing could be heard as they walked trhough the corridors carved in the rock itself, supported by impressive arches of stones reinforced by hundreds of runes.
Now, there was no dust any more, only dampness, which seeped from the walls and dripped to the ground.

Slowly, as they walked deeper underneath the castle, a groan could be heard, louder and louder…
Until they reached a dark grotto.
Only the deafening noise of a waterfall could be heard, the whole place made humid by the droplets saturating the air.

**"Light up!"**

The magica ball Vladmir created hovered to the centre of the grotto, revealing a fascinating place.

"We were wondering where part of the lake's water was going, now we have an answer," Severus mumbled, astounded at the waterfall, the basin in the middle, and finally the chasm that drew the water in.

But what the students focused on were the niches that were carved in the cavern's walls, housing corpses.
They really were in the Hogwarts Catacombs.

Hundreds of niches were visible all around the waterfall.
Hundreds of cadavers were lying in them.
Hundreds of dead people perfectly preserved.

"They look like they're sleeping," Draco whispered, stunned.

"There are embalming runes," Kevin noted, leaning over one of the niches, ignoring his friends' wary looks.
Merlin, who was interested in embalming runes?

"Where is Hermione?" Vladmir suddenly asked, worried.
"We should have caught up to her by now."

"There!"

All followed where Mary-Ann pointed.
Indeed, at the edge of the chasme, Hermione's figure was still walking.
A small ledge roughly carved in the stone was visible.
She had crossed the small stone bridge that went over the basin, which had a strong current in its mist, before getting to the small path snaking over the hole.

"Please, I hope she won't slip," Draco whispered, as they all looked a tthe young Gryffindor overlook the roaring abyss.

"We don't have much of a choice," Cedric murmured.
"We need to follow her."

Fortunately for them, they all were okay with heights, the only one afraid of them was Hermione, who probably did not even notice in her state.

As Vladmir stepped onto the stone bridge crossing the small lake, a faint growl rang out in the cave.

"Vlad…
What did…"

"… you do!" the twins screamed.

"Not good," Cedric whispered, looking around him, looking for the danger.

"Vladmir don't move!" Severus screamed, pointing to the water under him.

Indeed, it had started to glow a strange green.
Vladmir did not follow Severus's warning, and it did him good.
He jumped back quickly, raising a shield around him.
His instincts saved his life because at the exact spot where he was a few seconds earlier, a trident was swinging, buried deep in the stone.

"Selkies," Kevin declared, pointing to the dozens of water being who had just emerged.
The grey skin and yellow eyes were unique to those water beings living in the Black Lake.

After they had looked at each other silently, one of the females moved towards them, her fellow Selkies watching over her."

"What do you want, Humans?" the Selkie spat out, her voice gravelly.

"We are protecting our friend, who was here a few minutes ago," Kevin declared.

"The Dame has her court?" the being hissed.
"How can I be sure of that?"

"We are ready to swear a oath to that effect," Vladmir said softly, lowering his shield to show his good faith.

"You smell of an ancient magic… four of you," one of the Selkies said, his eyes clouded, revealing her blindness.

"What…" Cedric started softly.

"I am Luna Lovegood," the young Ravenclaw smiled, approaching the edge of the water.
"Here is Prince Severus, Prince Vladmir and his Kight-Mage, Kevin."

"So Artus's son is alive," the blind Selkie sighed
"They can go, Murcus.
The crown has always been fair to us, and dryads never were our enemies."

the leader emitted an unnerving squaking, probably their own language, and they debated for a few seconds.

"Go, Humans, and take care of the Dame," the blind Selkie declared.

"Why are they referring to Hermione as as Dame?" Cedric whispered to the twins.

"No idea," the mumbled back.

They exchanged a glance promissing bad moments to their friends if they did not explain further later, then slowly started to walk along the ledge.

They finally caught up to Hermione in a new room, this time a dry one that was lit up by charmed gems.

In the middle of the room lied four cristal blocks, inside which four people seemed to sleep, as preserved as the other corpses in the Catacombs.
The place was spotless, in a simple grey.
Only two tapestries were decorating the place: the first one, slightly off-white, was completely empty, while the second one was representing the Black Lake, with the Hogwarts domain in the background.

"Merlin…" Severus whispered, frozen in front of the tombs.
Even if no portrait from the time of the Founders existed, the two women and the two men lying in the sepulchres were easily identifyable.

At the same moment, Fawkes apeared in a fireball, holding André in his talons.

Kevin, Draco, and Vladmir let their friends admire the place, and pushed to the last room, while the others seemed meditating, eyes locked onto the last two Alliance members.

"Why was there no protection spell?" Cedric asked slowly.

"Simply because you had no ill intentions towards the Founders or Hogwarts.
On the contrary, you came here to protect them.
The Selkies are the only living guardians."

"Come again?"

Adrade Slytherin had a quite mocking sneer, while Fawkes was softly singing above the graves.

"The deads were enchanted by Salazar to wake up had you had ill will.
Selkies are the most intelligent water beings, and they swore to Helga that they would judge the intentions of all who passed their domain and kill them if need be.
Rowena has installed protection charms at the entrace of the tombs.
Godric has hidden a few traps on the ledge, which would have make you tumble down in the abyss.

All grew pale as they realized what they had avoided, before staying silent, looking at the small passageway their friends had disappeared into.
They knew that Vladmir, Kevin, and Draco did not really need their help now…

Meanwhile, the Alliance core was looking at the strange spectacle.
In the middle of the heap of gold and gems ‑ apparently the legends talking about dragon hoards seemed to be somewhat true ‑ there was a huge purple-scaled dragon.
It was sleeping so deeply that it seemed not to breathe.

And, curled up between the front paws, her head pushed over the vast snout with scales finer than the rest of the impressive reptile's body, Hermione seemed to also be sleeping.

_Flash_.
Kevin and Vladmir smirked at their friend, who was calmly straightening his hair and putting back his camera.

"She would not believe us otherwise," Draco argued.

"Of course," Kevin sneered.
"Nothing to do with the fact that you were moaning about the lack of Mione's picture in you secret Alliance album."

Draco was about to say that he was past the ago to have photo albums, but a glance from Vladmir dissuaded him.

"Well… who is getting Hermione?" Kevin asked.

Vlad raised his eyes to the incredibly high ceiling, and carefully approached the beast, softly hissing in Parsletongue.

"Clever," Draco whispered.

Dragons and Basilisks probably had different languages, but they were still reptiles and the sounds should be close.

"Guys, come help me," Vlad murmured.

Kevin and Draco approached in turn.
Vladmir did not want to use magic so close to a dragon, especially since it was one of the most dangerous breeds in the world, even if it was officially extinct.

Softly, they pulled Hermione up, freezing when the dragon moved slightly, provoking a slight earthquake.
A few coins rolled to the ground, and the noise was enough to get the rest of the group.
Vlad motioned them to stay back and they stopped at the entrance.

A hot breath escaped from Hogwarts's nose and Draco, who was still next to the dragon's head, grew pale when he saw a bloody red eye open and stared at him.
The Slytherin gulped, forcing himself to stay still and not panic, as the eye seemed to scrutinize him.

'Take care of her, Protector,' a voice in his mind whispered.
Then the eye closed back.

"Draco?" Vladmir asked.

The Slytherin turned to his friends, pale as a ghost.
They were looking at him, worried, and Draco realized that they had not seen a thing.

Gesturing that he was alright, he followed them to the Founders' Crypt, where Severus was casting diagnostic spells on Hermione.
She was all good.
She was probably subconsciently by Hogwarts, who was after all a dragon, and this a magical creature sensitive to the presence of a licorine.
It was thus possible that it had called here while being unconscious.

The Alliance was relieved: Hermione was unconscious, but alive, Hogwarts was still sleeping under the castle, and the Founders were still resting in peace.

The Mary-Ann started to laugh.
A soft laugh, relieved and happy, which rang out in the Crypt, as she was throwing herself in her brother's arms.
Luna was not far behind her, laughing in a clear and fresh voice as she twirled around the fraves.
No one had realized how tense they had been until now.

"We did it," Neville smiled.

"Yeah," Severus nodded.
"Neville, thank you for warning us."

The Gryffindor smiled, simply leaning on Godric Gryffindor's tomb.

"It's…"

"… completely crazy," George mumbled, sitting with his twin on the cristal protecting Salazar Slytherin.
They were staring at him, fascinated, their mind spinning like crazy at the pranks they could do if they managed to get a hand on one of the Founder's hairs.

"Oi, have so respect!" Draco and Severus yelled, feeling the coming danger for their loved Founder.

"Yes, young wizards, have some respect for my body."

All quickly turned to see, on what they had simply considered to be a tapestry of Hogwarts, four people appear, whose features were similar to but younger than the deads buried behind them.

"A… living tapestry?" Mary-Ann wondered, curious.

"Well, at the time of the Founders, paitings were rare," Kevin explained to his little sister.
"It was the Middle Ages, Pap, so we had in front of us the ancestors of magical portraits."

"Exactly, young man.
What year is this?"

"We are in 1994, Lord Slytherin," Vladmir declared.

"I do not remember we had a student coming from the Rus' in our time," a beautiful blond woman smile, whom they all recognised as Helga Hufflepuff.

"It is not important, dear, I see that those youngsters all belong to our Houses."

"The ginger ones make me think of you, Dric," Rowena Ravenclaw laughed, "they had the same spark for cheekiness, and the same fire hair.
Maybe descendants?"

"Not to own knowledge, Lady Ravenclaw," the Wealsey twins said in unison.

"This can be arranged," the Founder declared, poiting to the second tapestry.
"If you put some of you blood on the fabric and you are affiliated with one of us, your family tree will appear."

"If I may, what are students doing so far underneath the castle?" Gryffindor asked, nonchanantly leaning on his sword.
He was smiling when the twins rushed to the tapestry, before coming back to sit on Slytherin's grave, piqued that it had stayed blank.

"We have followed a friend in a trance," Cedric declared.

"This child?" Hufflepuff asked softly, staring at Hermione.

"There is not much child-like in her any more," Slytherin sneered, before getting slapped by Ravenclaw.

"Who is she?" the latter asked.

"Hermione Granger, Muggle-Born."

"You lie," Slytherin replied softly.

"Hermione Granger, Licorine," Severus sighed, which made the two female Founders hiccough in surprise.

"Howgarts must have called her…
And who are tou?" Gryffindor asked, seeming suddenly very interested.

"Severus Prince, Potions Professor…
I should have said Snape," he mumbled as he saw the four Founders kneel bofore him out of deference.

"You Highness," Rowena Ravenclaw murmured.

Severus sighed and went to sit with the twins, as annoyed as the twins, but for another reason.

"Rise," Kevin sniggered, looking at his Potions Professor's disappointed dace," he does not really appreciate the old chivalry codes."

"We only take orders from Princes and the King," Helga Hufflepuff declared, while they stayed down.

"What about Knight-Mages?" Kevin asked calmly, smiling affably.

"Hey, do you realize that the Founders just bowed in front of you?" Fred asked while Severus was sulking next to the twins.

"Something about royalty," the wizard mumbled.

"Wait, you are Artus's Heir?" Cedric stuttered.
"Merlin!"

"No, he's Severus," Vladmir said with a biting irony.
"I thank you, Founders, for managing to blow up the secret that the Five Families have tried to keep out of the public mind for centuries!"

Judging by the tone the wizard used, he was not pleased.
Gryffindor did not really appreciate Vladmir's tone, but before he had time to speak, Kevin intervened.

"I would advise you choose your words carefully, Founder.
You respect royalty, so stay silent in the presence of Prince Potter."

It was enough for the Founders to fall silent, despite all those questions.
They stayed silent as Vladmir demanded a blood oath to all who did not know the prestigeous line of their Potions Professor.
No one hesitated.

"We deeply apologize, your Highness," Helga Hufflepuff finally said, her voice soft.
"In you time, your line was not hiding.
Shouldwe understand that the royalty is no more?"

"It is not really," Draco sighed.
"However, the Royalist party is getting stronger.
The Ministry for Magic is corrupted and many wizarding families wish for the return of the monarchy.
Even Muggle-Borns are favourable."

"Oh, so the school still teaches first generations," Salazar Slytherin said with a good dose of satisfaction, shattering the myth that he had always refused the presence of Muggle-Borns in Hogwarts;

"Of course," André declared.
"And stop grumbling, Severus!" the Sorting Hat ordered.

The Potions Masters, still mumbling with the twins, simply the magical entity.

"Andrade?" Godric was surprised.

"No, I'm a dwarf in short trousers," the Sorting Hat bit back.
"I would say I am pleased to meet you, Godric, but you see, I still hold a gripe against you after a millenium."

Mary-Ann, feeling the situation would inflame, took the Sorting Hat by the top and put him on her head, distracting him with her very particular babbling.
His brother looking sadly at them, Andrade and Mary-Ann walked towards Severus.
The wizard sighed and allowed her to sit on his lap.

"Er…
Draco, could you…?" Cedric mumbled.

_Flash_.
The Slytherin's camera captured the memorable moment of the Severus Prince hilding a young girl on his lap, like a father would his child.
The man gave his godson a murderous look, but Draco simply smiled back mockingly, before looking back to the Founders.

"You are strange," Godric Gryffindor said.
"Lord Prince does not have the behaviour of a Professor, nor of a prince, and you, young students, you make me thing more of those Mirage Court delinquants, rather than students."

"Did the Court already exist when you were alive?" Neville wondered.

"Is it really this old?" Cedric added.

"Of course," Ravenclaw sniffed disdainfully.
"And it probably still exists, judging from your words."

"The Court?" Slytherin siggered with an amused shine in his eyes.
"My dear Godric, I am ready to bet that we are seeing the infamous Hogwarts cell."

"The Hogwarts cell," Vladmir repeated, interested.

"I do not know when the Mirage Court was created," Helga Hufflepuff resplied, "but it has always existed.
The oldest trace links back to the Temple of Apophis, which would be the ancestor of the Mirage Court.
And to get back to your question, Prince Potter, Hogwarts has always housed students belonging to the Mirage Court.
The Headmasters and Headmistresses still refer to it as the Hogwarts Cell."

Neville and Vladmir looked at each other.
They had to talk about it with Augusta to have access to the _Undeeground's_ archives.
Maybe they cwould be able to expand the Alliance and discover the former HQ!

Finally, after promissing to see them again soon ‑ the Founders did not want to spend another millenia alone ‑ the Alliance decided to go back to the surface.

They thus emerged in the dust-covered dungeons, muddy but more than satisfied of their night.
They had learned so much in a single night!
Hermione was alright, but they did not know exactly what happened to her.
The Founders had, contrary to popular belief, a portrait, or rather tapestry, of their own.
Maybe they could move it to the Headmistress's office?
The Mirage Court had always had a branch in the school, and they had to research that.

And because they were all lost in thought, no one realized that they were not alone any more.

"What are you doing out here at this time of night?" a voice behind them groaned.
A voice which, after the stress lived less than an hour before, provoked diverse reactions.

Thus Professor Moody, who was doing his weekly patrol, ingoring that the castle's protections were hightened, barely had time to register what was happening to him.
Three fundamentally Dark spells flew to him, along with two potions vials, and a few more common spells.

The result was… unappealing to say the least…
A slimy heap that bundled together several partial transformations.
Tentacles, some bits even still twitching scattered in the corridor, along with horrible blisters that covered the small part of remaining human skin…
Skin which was in a strange mixed tint of red and green, without mentioning the blueish blood dripping from the wounds.

"Woops…"

"That's quite the understatement," Cedric mumbled, Kevin's angelic and innocent blue gaze turning to him.

"Merlin, I had forgotten tonight's patroll," Severus grumbled, looking at his colleague's body, hurrying to cast the counterspell to his invention, the Sectumsempra.
"What potions have you thrown?"

The Weasley twins had mocking smiles.

"Blueddle," Fred said, referring to their experiments to create a humanoid squid.

"Slythindor," George giggled, mentionning their special weapon agianst their Slytherin ennemies, colouring their skin a nice read and their hair a pastel gree, quite far from the emeral green that was the Slytherins' favourite.

"Hence the suprising mix of red and gree tentacles… and if they are half ripped off and still twitching, Vladmir?" Severus sighed, getting a few vials out of his pocket and leaning over Moody to cast a few diagnostic spells.
Fortunately, there was a medical training before one could teach Potions…

"I have nothing to do with this!
I simply cast a _Cruciatus_!" the Russian took offence, explaining why what were formerly arms and legs were spasming.

"My fault, I cast a cutting spell," Kevin grumbled, Mary-Ann still behind him.

The young girl looked at her Defence Against the Dark Arts professor, fascinated at how quickly he was defeated by the mix of spells.

"Cedric? Neville?"

"Only a simply _Stupefy_," the Hufflepuff admitted, horrified to have assaulted a professor.

"I cast a plant growth retardant spell…
What?
It was the first that crossed by mind that was not a poison!"

"You properly knocked him out, Cedric," Severus observed.
"An excellent spell, and if he was counscious, you'd get congratulations from him.
On the other hand, it looks like your spell did not have any effect, Neville.
Luna?"

"He was missing the sun."

Severus raised an eyebrow, understanding the reason of the burns on the former Auror's sticky body.
A simple tanning spell could be devastating while staying perfectly legal.
He eventually turned to his godson, who lowered the powerful shield that he had raised around them and Hermione's unconsious body.

"Where is his wand?" the Potions Master enventually wondered.

Lunna giggled and pointed to the ceiling, where Moody's wand was calmly floating.

"Five points to Slytherin for this perfectly executed Levitation Charm, Miss Entwhistle," Severus chuckled while Kevin was ruffling his sister's hair.

She blushed and flicked her wand to make Moody's go into Severus's pocket.

"What now?" Cedric asked judisciously.

"We get him in front of the Hospital Wing," Severus sighed.
"Without the receipe for your potions, Messers Wealsey, I can't do anything, and St Mungo is much more equipped to treat magical accidents.

"Alright," Vladmir said.
"_Obliviate_!"

Erasing the last minutes from Moody's memory, he also made the evidence they were there from the corridors.

"I'm going to tell Grandmother," Neville sighed.
"She won't be happy, but oh well…"

"It's good to have the Headmistress on our side," Fred laughed.

"She won't say anything?" Cedric was surprised.

"She knows exactly what we are doing," Neville smiled softly.
"We both have the same tattoo."

Cedric opened his eyes wide as he finally realized why, even if the Alliance was relatively secret, it had free rein in the whole school as long as they did not get caught.

"I'll go with you," Vladmir declared.
"It is nearly six in the morning and I have to go back to Russia to solve a clan problem.
Katya and Aleksei's father have been negociating the whole night for a treaty.
It will be signed at noon, and as the heir I have to be present to seal it," he added at the questionning look he got.

"Aleksei as well?"

"Yes.
After that, we will publish an article in the _Red Dawn_ to tell the whole wizarding world that we are protecting the Vesafine, before going to hte Dlavonines."

"Clan war?" Kevin worried, understanding more quickly that the others the implications of a visit in an adversarial clan.

"The point is to avoid it.
Ubista, Sergei and myself will meet with Ratislav Dlavonine, the clan's leader, to make him understand that harming the Vesafine is also harming the Kemenovs."

"You will be back for the Goblet of Fire's choice."

Vladmir laughed at Luna's affirmation.

"I trust you on that.
Cedric, go put your name in the Goblet and become the Hogwarts champion.
Fred, George… good luck!"

In a flash, Vlamdir went to the Headmistress's office to transit through the Ministry for Magic to Russia.

After dropping off their Defence Against the Dark Arts professor in front of the Hospital Wing and going back to their Common Rooms, the Alliance members allowed themselves a long lie-in, only emerging from their respective dormitories for lunch.
Only Hermione was still unconscious and entrusted to Severus, who lied her down in one of the comfortable Chamber of Secrets settees.

Early in the afternoon, when Hermione woke up, she was surrounded by her Alliance friends, who were worried for her;
Only Draco, mary-Ann and Cedric were missing, spending time with their respective friends.

They told Hermione her adventures with a dragon guardian, using phtographs as evidence, and the young woman admitted that she had strange and short memories that did not belong to her.
They were about bloody red eyes, but also a mysterious island.

"I think you had memories from the dragon.
We should talk about it with the Founders or the Sorting Hat, but I think it was Hogwarts that pulled you to him," Severus declared softly.
"You are a Licorine, and the old dragon races are among the most powerful and intelligent kinds of magical creatures.
He must have felt your presence, even while sleeping.
If you have trouble with those memories, come see mee.
Andrade and myself will do what we can to help you, and possibly understand them."

Hermione nodde, and Cedric finally joined, them, along with a Draco who seemed like he did not sleep.

"What's up, Draco?" Severus asked.

"I'm good, Godfather.
Blaise and Theo just got me as I got out of the shower.
They absolutely wanted to do homework before going to plonking themselves in the Great Hall to look at the potential champions."

"So you did not sleep," Kevin summarized.
"Here…"

He held out a deep blue potion to him.

"Take it, Draco, if I'm not mistaken it's a fortifying potion.
Mister Entwhistle, please tell me you don't abuse it!"

"No, Professor," Kevin smiled.
"I simply sell it overprice to the others who work themselves to death on homework."

"This…"

"… is…"

"… our…"

"… sneaky…"

"… and…"

"… clever…"

"…Kevin…" the Wealsey twins giggled, taking out their accounting books to know how long they had sold it for, and especially if they had enough stock to extend it to the other Houses for the end of the year, for the revising before the exams.

"Do I have to deduce that you are the one helping yourself in the reserve?" Severus whispered.

"Of course," Kevin smiled innocently.
"After all, it is the Alliance's."

Severus stayed silent, not able to counter the Ravenclaw's logic, nor even rebuking him for brewing a potion alone.
The Invigorating Potion was in the second year's curriculum, and he was more than competent in Potions.

After a few conversations between the twins, responsible for the distribution of several goods in the school, and Kevin, who wanted some percentage on the sales as the make, they decided to all go the the Great Hall to look at the potential champions.

"By the way, Cedric, did you put your name in the Goblet of Fire yet?" Hermione asked, as they scattered out of the Alliance Headquarters.

"No, I wanted you all to be here," the seventh year blushed slightly.

"Hufflepuff," Draco mumbled, before being elbowed by Hermione.

"I know, Malfoy, but strangely, I felt the need to have my friends around me to support me."

It was now Draco's turn to blush slightly at Cedric's declaration of friendship.
The Hufflepuff had never really said that he liked them, and it was always nice.

The three students enventually joined with Fred and George to go to hte Great Hall, where the Goblet of Fire was waiting for them.
Seeing the twins' buffoonery and their triumphant smile, Cedric wondered what idiocy they had managed to do.
Lee, next to the twins, seemed to be in the know and was smiling from ear to ear.

"Don't know," Hermione sighed.
"I think they brewed an aging potion.
Severus spent all morning giggling over his cauldrons when he learned about it.
It was…"

Hermione shivered at the memory of the Potions Master going back and forth between satisfied sniggering and unsellting giggling, leaning over a cauldron, the glowing fumes around his face making him look like a demon.
He was, at this moment, the perfect cliche of the horrible wizards in the Muggle fairy tales, minus the warts.
Not the best thing to look at when waking up.

"This much?" the Hufflepuff worried.

"Yep.
Don't worry, you're not the one cheating," Hermione reassured him, patting his arm.
"Come on, Champion!
I need to go help Ronald with Potions!"

And she took Draco's arm and pulled him towards the group of Gryffindors, ignoring his protest.

"Not surprising," Cedric mumbled, who had already heard the Potions Master grousing against the second to last Wealsey the previous year, as Severus was leaning of the Gryffindors' essays in the Chamber of Secrets.
As Hermione was disappearing into the Great Hall, a young woman wearing the Ravenclaw crest half jumped on him, euphoric.

"Cedric!"

"Cho," the Hufflepuff smiled.

"Did you put your name in?"

"Not yet, I was going to!"

"You were with Gragner?"

"Granger," Cedric sighed.
"Granger.
And stop being jealous, she is just a friend."

"She better be!" Cho said.

Cedric sighed again, looking at his girlfriend of nearly two year's bronzed face.
He loved her, but he was getting fed up with her continuous jealousy.
At this moment, the Ravenclaw was looking daggers at Hermione, who was laughing next to Ron and Draco… even though the latter seemed to want to be anywhere but surrounded by a group of Gryffindors.

The Hufflepuff hestitated for a few moments, then chose to stay silent.
If he said something the gorgeous but incredibly chatty young woman he was honoured to be the boyfriend did not like, he would be sure that the whole school knew it the next morning…

"I'm going," Cedric eventually said with a smile, taking a small piece of parchment from his pocket.
He freed his arm and approached the age limit, which he crossed without a problem.
He put his name him, and as he had already seen, a small spray of fmales swallowed the parchment.

"You're gonna be the Hogwarts Champion, I'm sure of it," Cho laughed, only pecking his lips to avoid remarks from the few professors there.

"We'll see…"

Cedric heard a sharp explosion, and the first thing he thought about, probably out of habit, was the Weasley twins.

He turned around and like the rest of the Great Hall, he burst out laughing.
Fred and George, lying on the ground, half laughing and half writhing in pain, both had magnificient white beards.

"This is not Augusta's work," Hermione laughed.

"No, I think it's Severus's," Neville giggled.

"Which would explain his terrific good humour all morning," Draco shivered.

"He's your godfather, though?"

"Yeah, but some of his expressions are…
brrrr…" he shivered again.

"You are the godson of the Dungeons' Bat?" Ron was horrified, getting daggers from said godson.

"Idiot!"

"Ouch, Mione!"

Neville laughed out loud at the sight of Ron rubbin the crown of his head after he got quite violently hit by a boook.

"You were saying?" she whispered.

"You are scary," Ron pouted.

"Ronny is afraid of Mione!" Fred suddenly yelled, embracing his brother to drown him into his long white beard.

"He's becoming a man!" George yelled not to be outdone.

"It's like mom…"

"… and dad!"

A now scarlet Ronal Weasley managed to emerge from the thick beards, while the Great Hall was still laughing at the family's tomfoolery.
Without daring to look at Hermione, the Gryffindor quickly left the room, ignoring the sarcastic sniff from Draco.

"Sory about him," George said, winking at the Slytherin.

"He always talks before thinking…"

"… but we'll eventually make somehting of him!"

"I'd advise you get checked out at the Hospital Wing," an easily recognisable voice whispered.
The small group turned to see Professor Severus Prince, slyly leaning over them like a falcon.
While his face seemed furious, his eyes were sparkling in mischieviousness.

"You…" the twins started.

"We corrupted you!" the first whispered, putting a hand on his heart.

"Will it rain Kneazles tomorrow?" the second one was horrified.

An amused rictus stretched Severus's lips as the twins were simulating a heart attack.

"Go see Madam Pomfrey before I get you there myself… and forbid your access to the laboratory for a month," he added in a low voice.

The second threat was much more efficient, and Fred and George ran away, getting Lee at the same time, who was busy flirting with one of the Beauxbâtons Veelas.

"Are you okay, Hermione?" Severus asked softly, ignoring the suspicious looks from the other students, not used to seeing the horrible Potions Professor harrass Hermione Granger.

"I am.
I did not have more flashes since this morning."

"Good.
If they return, tell me.
And get the word going.
Occlumency lessons for everyone tonight."

Hermione nodded, as did Draco.
As Severus was walking away, he passed by Kevin with Luna, her young cousin Leonis, Mary-Ann, and Clarisse.

"Where is Mister Kemenov?" Severus asked out loud.

"I do not know Professor Prince.
He said something about an urgent family meeting in Russian," Kevin answered softly, slightly worried.

All the Alliance members were also worried, Vladmir's words before going to Russian in the morning still fresh in their minds…
Fortunately, he was back towards the end of the afternoon with Aleksei, wearing a satisfied smile.

"As Luna predicted, right on time," Kevin laughed, leaving some room for him at the Ravenclaw table for the dinner.

The Great Hall was already full, and all had their eyes on the Goblet of Fire, which was now in the middle of the Professors' table.

The feast felt too long for many people, although bursts of laughter could be heard from the SLytherin table when Kevin told them the misadventure the Weasley twins had with the Goblet of Fire.

"Youngsters, it is not time to know which Champions the Goblet of Fire will choose," the Headmistress announced, while the last remains of the meal disappeared.
"The champions will go to the neighbouring room, where they will recieve their first instructions."

A respectuous silent fell down as all were focused on the severe Lady Longbottom, as well as on the Headmistress and Headmaster and the representatives from the Ministry.
Lord Rowle, Selwyn and Bagman were there, giving the magical object a particular attention.

Suddenly, the Goblet of Fire's blue flames turned red, throwing sparks in the whole room and a burst of fire sprang out of it, spitting out a darkened piece of parchment.

"Durmstrang's champion will be Viktor Krum," the Headmistress declared in a clear voice.

Clapping roared in the Great Hall as the Quidditch world vice-champion rose up, congratulated by his Durmstrang friends.
As soon as he closed the door of the small room, the Goblet of Fire became red again.

Silent returned immediately, every one holding their breath before a second piece of parchment was thrown out.

"Beauxbâtons' champion is Fleur Delacour!" Augusta announced.

Vlamdir and Kevin looked with miwed feelings at the Veela stand up, smiling, and go to the room under the acclamations of the students in the room.

"Many are disappointed," Luna noted, pointing to the extremity of the table, where representatives from Rochefroide looked bitter.

"Rochefroide is often in Beauxbâtons' shadow, they had a change to stand out for once," Vladmir explained, sipping his tea.

"The Hogwarts champion will be Cedric Diggory!"

All the Hufflepuff students were overjoyed, as were the Alliance members.
The other tables seemed disappointed, but still clapped.
Cedric was respected by all the Houses, which made things easier.

"I count on all of you to…"

Augusta fell silent when the Goblet of Fire turned scarlet again, spitting out a new piece of parchment…
She caught it and stared at the name for a long time, before looking at a student in particular.

"Vladmir Kemenov…" Augusta choked, losing her self-control for a fraction of a second.

She put the note in her pocket, promissing herself to analyze it later to try and find magical residue.
She knew perfectly well that Vladmir never would have registered himself for the Tri-Wizard Tournament.

Vlamdir, on his part, was frozen, eyes opened wide in shock, while every one was looking at him.
Only an nudge from Kevin took him out of his thoughts as the whisperes around him grew stronger.

Without missing a beat, he stood up, but instead of joining the room, he climbed on the Ravenclaw table and got his wand out, pointing it on his wrist.
He was going to make things clear immediately.

"I, Vladmir Vassilievitch Kemenov, Prince Potter, Heir of Clan Kemenov, Tsesarevich of Russia, swear on my magic that I never wanted to participate in the Tri-Wizard Tournament, and therefore therefore have not put my name in the Goblet of Fire, nor asked any one else to put my name in."

In a heavy silence, he cast a small _Lumos_, proving that he was telling the truth.
But before the whispers started again, Vladmir had a cold stare.

"I, Vladmir Vassilievitch Kemenov, Prince Potter, Heir of Clan Kemenov, Tsesarevitch of Russia, swear a Vow of Vengeance to find the person responsible for my registration to the Tri-Wizard Tournament and kill them.
So be it!"

The wave of magic that gushed from the young Russian's body was enough to cause a cold wind to sweep the Great Hall, as all the Pure-Bloods in the room grew pale.
Vows of Vengeance were rare, and generally created the conditions for blood baths.

"Go join the other champions," Augusta declared softly.

Vlad nodded and climbed down from the table to go to the secondary room.
His trip was done in silence.
No one dared to whisper, shocked by the two consecutive oaths.

When he entered, his gaze stopped on Cedric and Viktor sitting down to talk next to the chimney.
Fleur Delacour was lost in the contemplation of the flames but turned her head when he entered.

"What are you doing here, your Highness?" Fleur asked in a worried voice, staring as Vladmir was crossing the door.

"Heir Kemenov will be enough, _Heretem_ Delacour," he groaned.

"Something wrong, Vlad," Cedric worried.

"Very.
Some one forced my participation in the Tournament.
I have just made two vows to deny my responsibility and find who did it."

"A vow of vengeance, hey?" Viktor understood, his face turning serous.

Vows of vengeance were used way more often in Slavic countries, compared to Western Europe.

"Incredible!" Bagman suddenly exclaimed as he entered the room.
"A fourth champion!"

"Augusta, what can you do?
He cannot participate!" Dame Maxime's voice yelled out as she entered to room.

"I would like to withdraw him, Olympe, but you know the magical contract," Augusta sighed.

"Two champions for Hogwarts," Karkaroff sniggered.
"I don't remember that the hosting school was allowed to enter two champions, or did I misread the regulations?"

**"Enough Karkaroff,"** Vlamdir growled.
**"I did not want this, so spare me the sarcasm!"**

Karkaroff grew pale while Viktor was sniggering behind his back.

"Lord Rowle," Vlamdir continued, seeing the new Head of the Department of International Coorperation appear, "would you happen to have a solution to reduce the injustice for Durmstrang and Beauxbâtons?"

Damocles looked carefully at the Heads of the schools, then the four champions.

"Felix, could you write down a magical contract identical to the one for the Goblet of Fire?"

"Yes, Lord Rowle.
Our sollicitors will scour the archives and will have a contract by tomorrow," Felix Selwyn declared, seeming to know what Damocles was thinking.

"Then get to it.
Headmaster Karkaroff, Dame Maxime, for equity reasons, I am proposing that your student chose a second champion among themselves.
We will do the tasks in pairs, which will allow to orient the tournament not on individual qualities, but on teamwork."

"It is acceptable to me," Olympe Maxime declared after a few seconds to consider it.

"To me as well," the Durmstrang Headmaster eventually conceded.

"Good.
Then please summon your students to another room to chose a second champion," Lord Rowle asked.
"Ludovic, would you please join Felix to think about the necessary changes to the future tasks?"

The different school Heads went with Augusta to fetch their students, while Bagman was quickly joining his colleague in the Ministry.

Damocles sighed, then turned to Vladmir, after formally greeting Cedric who, as heir of an old Pure-Blood family, he had some respect for.

"I don't know how you do that, Vladmir, but you have a gift for getting in trouble."

"You know Damocles, I have quite the talent to find trouble," the Russian sighed.

"I wonder what Katya will do," the Head of International Cooperation sighed, "but I hope she will not create a diplomatic incident."

"Too much paperwork?" Vlad asked sarcastically.

After a few minutes, Augusta came back and motionned for the two students to come with them.
Damocles went back to his seat, while the Headmistress stood in front of the Professors' table, the two Hogwarts students standing in front of the stage in front of her.

Silence immediately came back and all waited for the Headmistress to talk.
However, Damocles Rowle was the one to do it.

"The contracts resulting from being chosen by the Goblet of Fire being magical, Vladmir Kemenov is forced to participate.
However, because of the flagrant injustice this represents for our guests, the jury has made a decision.
Each delegation will chose a second champion through an internal vote.
Thus the tasks of the Tri-Wizard Tournament will happen in pairs and will also allow use to judge your teamwork.
Because a wizard or a witch, whatever their power level, is nothing when facing the hugeness of the world and Magic."

At this moment, the delegations came back to settle down at the tables, while the Heads each gave a small slip of paper to Augusta.
Then they placed themselves behind the champions and their help.

Augusta quickly read the papers and smiled.

"Following the votes of our guests, allow me to introduce you to: the Beauxbâtons champion, charming Fleur Delacour, and her right-hand man representing Rochegroide, Matthieu Bousquet.
For Durmstring, we have the famous Viktor Krum and his right-hand man Aleksei Vasefine.
Finally, representing Hogwarts, none other than the HufflePuff Prefect, Cedric Diggory, assisted by Vladmir Kemenov!"

The applause, contrary to Vladmir's nomination less than an hour before, were numerous and everyone was satisfied by the choice of Hogwarts champions.
Hufflepuff was represented by none other than their star Seeker, and was not relegated to the last place as often happened.
Ravenclaw also had its champion in the duo, but neither Slytherin nor Gryffindor felt wronged.
Vladmir had been one of the first to break down the inter-House walls, and he was  in good terms with three quarters of his year, whatever their colours.

"Now that this mistake has been fixed," the Head of Magical Cooperation, know that an inquiry will be started concerning Mister Kemenov's forced participation.
I hope none of you is implicated, because if I learn that it was because of one student, I will make sure they are expelled from the school…
Unless Mister Kemenov get his hand on you first…"

Vladmir's bloody smile concluded the night, starting the Tri-Wizard Tournament on an uneasy note.
