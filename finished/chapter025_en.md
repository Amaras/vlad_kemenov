# Chapter 25: Stories about nobility

Hermione was smiling.
She could not help but smile, not after the end of the Defence Against the Dark Arts lecture.
Ronald, even if he had calmed down a bit since a few days before -- and she had to thank Fred and George to make him understan indirectly that the more he would insult her, the more he would be a test subject -- had just had the fright of his life.

"You seem quite happy, Granger."

Hermione smirked when she greeted Draco, who was waiting in front of the Great Hall door for dinner.
The young Pure-Blood raised an eyebrow, surprised to see on her face an expression he was more used to seeing on Valdmir's face or even his.
As a model Slytherin, he did not ask her about it, knowing she would eventually talk about it.
He only galantly reached out his arm, and Hermione laughed at his manners, letting herself be led to the Ravenclaw table, the neutral one.

They regularly ate together, but the cohoice of the table had been a survival choice for Hermione and Neville.
Going to the Gryffindors, where they were already treated like pariahs because of their friendship with the prince of Slytherins, was simply out of the question.
As for going to the Slytherins, it was not a problem for that House, according to Draco.
He had discreetly investigated to know if the presence of two Muggle-Borns and lions offended someone.
Some protestations had been raised, but Draco was a Malfoy, and one had better not cross the heir of the family.
No one had been particularly vindictive, but Kevin had said that going to the enemy would worsend the relationship Hermione and Neville had with their own House.
Thus, there only was the Ravenclaw table left, as they did not know the Hufflepuffs enough to allow themselves to invade their space.

Kevin and Vladmir already had their appetizers in front of them, lively talking with fourth and fifth years on an obscure subject of ancestral magic.
Bradley, who still wore his Prefect insigna, smiled when he saw the second years coming.

"Whell, what are a lion and a snake doing in enemy territory?" he joked, pushing himself away to leave some space for them.

"I's say it's rather neutral territory," a small dreamy voice said.
"May I?"

Bradley, focused on his conversation, jumped when he realized that a small first-year blond girl was standing behind him.
Luna still had her day bag and a necklace made of multi-coloured threads, on which a monocle served as a pendant, adorning her neck.
He smiled as he stood up to leave his spot to the girl.

"See you later.
You'll be more at ease with a bit more space and not packed like sardines!"

"'Packed like sardines'?" Draco noted.

"Muggle expression," Hermione sighed.
"When will you dare learn something about my world?"

"When Leprechauns become bankers!" Draco retorted.
"I'm perfectly at ease in the magical world, I have no reason to lose myself amogst the Muggles.

Meanwhile, Luna had sat down next to Vladmir, who was observing her helping herself, keeping immobile and with an expressionless face that heavily contrasted with the young Ravenclaw's dreamy face.
Luna seemed to feel his stare, and raised her eyes to look at his.

"You seem quite happy, Mione," Kevin said, unknowingly used Draco's exact words from a few minutes before;
Kevin was following from the corner of his eyes the exchange between the two eagles, curious of Vladmir's behaviour, but Hermione's extatic face and her amused sneer were to rare not to ask about.

"Did you know Ronald was afraid of spiders?" Hermione exclaimed.

"I did," Neville said, sitting down next to his Housemate, covered in dirt after the time he spent in the Greenhouses.
"He had quite the panic attack at the start of the year when he woke up to see an innocent harvest spider.
I don't know which one was the most afraid between the small creature that ran as fast as its legs could go, and him...
But today's reaction was not bad as well!"

"What do you mean?" Draco eagerly asked, not wanting to lose an occasion to scare off the redhead.
He spent his time teasing Ronald, who immediately got angry, to the delight of the young Malfoy's friends.
Hermione explained to them that according to Ronald, the rivalry between their families started generations ago, in an obscure affair about marraiges that provoked the Weasleys' ruin.
It made Draco laugh out loud, as he had a very different version.
None of his friends tried to take sides in those rivalries, prefereing to observe the exchanges.

Well, he made quite maginicient vocalizations while running the fastest sprint in Hogwarts' history," Neville explained.

"Because of a small spider?" Vladmir aksed, surprised.

"Not one...
A small line of diverse arachnids, from a cupboard harvest spider, to one of the big cave spiders."

"That confirms our suspicions," Kevin whispered.

Their research material said that spiders fled as quickly as possible from a Basilisk.
It confirmed Vladmir's hypothesis about the presence of a snake king in the castle.

Two readheads passed by at this moment behind them, making dubious puns and accidentally shoving Vlad.
The Russian smiled as he discreetly put a note in his pocket, note that had suddenly appeared underneath his plate like by magic.

"They did not find it," Luna whispered as she observed a group of visibly furious Slytherin seventh years, all wearing a magnificient scarlet and gold mane, and walking briskly towards the twins.
Vlad, the only one to hear her words, tilted his head while looking back to her blue eyes.
She knew things she should not, and it intrigued him.
His behaviour, quite peculiar, immediately caught his friends' attention.
Kevin, who was following this exchange since the beginning, quickly tried to get their attention.

"So, Draco, ready for tomorrow's match?"

"Tell me about it!
Slytherin v. Gryffindor," the blond sighed.
"It's the first match of the year, and the worse to start as Seeker.
It's Hogwarts' derby: either I'm celebrated, or I'm lynched!"

"You'll be fine.
You were quite good during the selections, and, by the way, I did not know you knew how to do the Wrnski Feint this well," Neville said, the only one to understand Kevin's attention grabbing scheme.
He looked at him, full of suspicions, to which the young eagle responded with an angelic smile.
The Longbottom heir sighed and focused his attention back on the discussion.

"You were there for the selections?" Draco noted with genuine surprise.

"Yes, we were all there, even Hermione.
And you know her passion for Quidditch!
We all came to support a friend," Kevin declared without suspecting his words would petrify the young Malfoy.

"I did not see you," Draco eventually said, moved.
He had been disappointed that he did not see his Alliance friends for the selections for Chasers and Seeker.
Indeed, it was strictly forbidden for other Houses to see the trials, but they had broken enough rules that it was not a hinderence.

"Flint told us that he did not want our presence to distract his player, and that e had to be invisible, or he would make sure Snape gave us detention for half the year."

Draco gazed at his friends one after the other.
Hermione looked at him, amused, as did Kevin, while Neville and Vladmir, as the proper heirs they were, only gave him a slight smile that meant a lot to him.
It was the first time he truly realized that they were more than classmates he got along with, like Theo and Daphne were.
This little group were true friends who supported him.
A friend like the one he had with Blaise Zabini.

"I..."

"Frankly, I don't see why you are so suprised," Luna eventually whispered softly.
"They're your friend, it's normal for them to supprot you."

Draco gazed at the young, blonde Ravenclaw and softly smiled at her.

"I know Lovegood, I had just never realized how much this friendship was importnat for me."

Something passed over Luna's gaze, and her eyes grew clearer when she stared into Draco's grey eyes.

"You are lucky, Draco."

"I know, they don't judge me by my reputation," Draco softly nodded, knowing Luna's reputation.
"But you too will find people will will trust and accept you as you are."

A peaceful silence came over them, which they used to fill their plates and their bellies.
They had gotten to desserts when Draco got called out.

"Malfoy, don't forget tonight's training session!"

Draco turned around to see Marcus Flint, captain of Slytherin's team, standing behind them, a smile on his lips.
Draco simply nodded, and his captain left the room with several other students.

"Why was he smiling this much?" Vlad asked, finishing his serving of molasses pie.

"My father offered the whole team Nimbus 2001 brooms to celebrate my selection.
I told him it was a bit too much, but he only said that of Slytherin did not ant them, he would offer them to other Houses.
I did not have a choice."

"It's gonna be a talking point," Hermione declared.
"Many will think you bought your position."

"I'm quite used to rumours," Draco sighed, "one more is not the end of the world."

"That's sad," Kevin said.

"What?" 

"To be this blas√© at only twelve.
You sound like a war veteran saying nothing can impress him, because he saw all the world's horrors already," Kevin explained.

"You're not far from the point," Neville whispered.
"Numerous old families are subject to rumours and prejudice.
When you spent your whole childhood hearing people say you are a Squib, not worthy enough to be a Longbottom, and probably a bastard to be this weak, insults eventually slip right over your mind."

"Dad and Uncle Ami are considered mad," Luna admitted with a small voice that revealed that she still had trouble not caring about the derogatory remarks.
"Everyone calls me Loony and laugh at me because I don't see the world the same way you do."

Hermione made a strange face, visibly ready to discuss the truth on Luna's creatures which clashed with her rationality, but Draco nudged her, gesturing her to shut up.
Levegoods were considered mad, but they were geniuses and visionaries.
Only old families remembered their prescience gift, which they kept hidden.

"Should I flaunt my misfortune?" Vlad declared in an openly mocking tone to de-dramatise the room.
"I am a horrible Dark mage, a killer of the worst kind.
I'm not the Survivor anymore, I am the Dark Prince."

"Still better than the Boy-Who-Lived," Kevin sneered.
"They were not very original on nicknames!"

"We should ask Lisa to give you a better nickname," Neville smiled.
"Word about her talent already spread all over the school.
Is it true she calls Snape 'Snappy'?"

"She does, and she even got detention and a 50-point penalty for it in last week's Potions class.
I never saw Hufflepuffs be this dumbfounded, nor Snape this furious!" Kevin recalled in wonder.

"By the way, it makes me think that you four are invited to the manor for the first week of the holidays!" Draco intervened.

"We're talking about Snape, and you're thinking about the holidays?" Neville aked with horror.

"Severus is my Godfather, so he's a family member for me.
And family means holidays!"

"We're all invited?" Hermione asked suspiciously.

"Mother is not pleased," Draco grimaced," but Father imposed it to her.
Anyway, bring a party dress."


"Party dress?" Kevin repeated, growing pale.
"Are you organizing a party?"

"The manor host this year's Saturnalia ball, for Winter's Soltice.
All the aristocracy and the wizarding political world will be present."

"There's no way I'm going," Kevin made a firm decision.

"Why?" Hermione wondered.
"It will be very instructive."

"Hermione, do I need to remind you where I come from?" the young Muggle-Born grumbled.
"I never went to a ball, and I do not know how to dance anything but the jig!"

"You don't have to dance," Vlad said, "and if you behave as usual, nobody will imagine you don't have aristocratic blood."

"Where do you come from?" Draco noted, curious.

"From a dark world, under the earth."

All turned their head towards Luna, who was staring at Kevin with big eyes filled with wonder.

"Did you meet Gomines? Ginger Colliers?" Luna said, jumping up and down on the bench, a huge smile on her lips, her blond hair twirling in all directions.
"Could you make me visit the tunnels? And..."

"Calm down Little Elf!" Kevin exclaimed, raising his hands to appease her.
"But how do you know I come from a family of miners?"

To his great embarassement, Luna immediately began to sob.

"But... I didn't say anything!" Kevin defended himself as Hermione looked daggers at him, trying her best to console the small Ravenclaw.
Fortunately, few people were left in the Great Hall as the dinner had been over for a long time, because they caught the attention of the rare pople remaining.

"I... It's... It's the first time...somebody call me something this kind," Luna still sobbed.

Kevin widened his eyes.
He had spontaneously called her Elf, seeing how curious and mischievous, with her fine face only missing pointy ears.

"I... well, usually you make me thing of a fairy with how dreamy and short you are, but now, jumping up and down like that, I thought about an elf," Kevin whispered, passing his hand in his hair in embarrassement.
He suddenly paled.
"What do you keep crying?"

Luna had burst into tears once again against Hermione, as Vladmir laughed at his friend's spontaneity and innocence, which let his age show for once.

"I did not know you were this awkward with girls," Draco snickered.

"I didn't say anything!" the Muggle-Born repeated.

The other three boys rolled their eyes simultaneously.

"If you're not coming to the ball, I'll get to your house to kidnap you," Draco threatened, coming back to the previous subject.
"I absolutely do not want to be bored like last year!
Luna, I hope we'll see you as well."

Luna raised her head, her eyes red, and softly nodded, her face had transformed back to her dreamy usual.

"Dad has received the invitation.
He did not want to go, but I'd like to come with you."

"I will have to ask my parents," Hermione said, quickly imitated by Kevin, who was silently praying for his parents' refusal.

"Well, Grandmother thought I would go either to Draco's or to Vlad's, you know I will be there," Neville smiled.

"If you had not invited us, I would have," Vlad declared simply.
"Don't worry, we'll snoop around your home for a week.
I'm sure your manor is full of interesting things."

"Ahem... It's time to leave the Great Hall."

All turned to see Professor Flitwick standing next to Luna, worriedly looking at Luna's cheeks, still wet from her tears.
His black eyes still let his pleasure to see the group take the young girl under their wing show.
The Prefects regularly let him know the incidents she was a vitctim of, but until she complained herself, he could not intervene.
Flitwick hoped Kevin and Vladmir would help her.

"Miss Lovegood, you should go rest in your room.
Mr. Bradley will accompany you," he added, refering to the Prefect who was waiting in the entryway of the Great Hall.
Luna nodded and stood up to leave the room.
However, she stopped next to Kevin, and kissed him on the cheek.

"Thank you," she said before skipping to Bradley, leaving a blushing and petrified Kevin behind.
The Ravenclaw was still getting teased a few minutes later as they traversed the Entry Hall, walking towards the Alliance room.

"Excuse me..."

The small group stopped before stepping up the stairs and turned simulteanously towards the source of the soft voice that interrupted them.
A young girl with long, ginger, braided hair and big hazel eyes was timidly observing them.
She were the gold and black coat-of-arms of Hufflepuff, and standing behind here were two members of her House, as well as the Astronomy professor.
They were all wondering what Aurora Sinistra was doing there with three Hufflepuff students when the shy girl spoke with a strangely firm voice.

"I am Susan Amelia Bones, heir to the noble Bones family.
I request an audience with the Potter heir."

The use of the Potter name surprised Hermione and Kevin, especially because Vladmir did not object to it.
The turn of phrase particularly protocol driven made them especially curious, although they did not show it.
They showed no emotion either when Draco and Neville stood behind Vladmir, carefully watching their placement.
They were on each side of the Russian, a step behind him, exactly in the same position as the other two Hufflepuffs, while Professor Sinistra stopped between Vlad and Susan.

"I Draco Lucius Malfoy, heir to the noble Malfoy family, am a witness to the request", the blond declared.

"I am Neville Franck Longbottom, heir to the noble Longbottom family, second witness to the request for the Potter heir."

"I am Vladmir Vassilievitch Kemenov, heir to the noble Potter and Kemenov families. I accept the request from the Bones heiress."

"I am Cedirc Amos Diggory, heir to the noble Diggory family.
I note this audience," a tall Hufflepuff they had seen in the Qudditch team announced.

"I, Anthony Wilius McMillan, heir to the noble McMillan family, am a witness of the request," the seconc one, presumably Ernie's older brother, declared.

"As an adult representative authorisedby Lady Bones and Lady Kemenov I note the request was proper and authorise the audience," the Professor intervened.

Vladmir and Susan walked away from possible eavesdroppers, the few students present in the entry hall looking at them.
Several started to talk and Kevin leaned towards Draco.

"What just happened?"

"I think Vlad has a marriage contract with Susan Bones," Draco whispered.
"You just witnessed an official audience.
As betrothed, they have to follow the protocol for an official meeting, in front of four witnesses of their social class.
Diggory and McMillan are both Pure-Blood and noble."

"But they met already!" Hermione said, surprised.

"Not according to the etiquette!
It's complicated," Neville whispered when Kevin looked at him, astonishment on his face.
"I think they are discussing an audience between their magical guardians."

"Why?"

"A marriage arranged according to the ancient laws has to follow several steps to be valid.
It is contracted at the birth of the children.
Then, there has to be an official presentation in front of four witnesses, with at a minimum an adult, who may be one of the witnesses and who represents the guardians if they are asent," Draco whispered, not looking away from the pair who were vividly talking.

"After the first audience, an official audience between the parties is organised to present the marriage agreement and validate the engagement.
The wedding generally happens the day the youngest betrother turns 17."

"Can a contract be broken?"

"It can.
However, it's as complex.
If the two parties have the same rank..."

"What do you mean, rank?" Hermione cut him.

"Bones are princes," Neville explained.
"So are Potters.
Their rank is identical.
Longbottoms are lower down the nobility hierarchy, so our rank is different."

"As I was saying," Draco continued, looking daggers at Hermione who interrupted his explanations, "if they have the same rank, both guardians must agree to break the contract.
If the ranks are different, only the higher guardian may break the engagement, even without the other's approval.
That's what happened with my arranged marriage.
The Parkinsons are mere Earls, and fortunately for me, because Pansy's father would have never accepted!"

Quite a long time later, Vladmir came back, relaxed and smiling, while Susan went towards her itnesses.

"I am invited to the Bones' for lunch on 26 December," he declared.
"I will have to abandon you for the dat."

"Engaged?" Draco asked for the confirmation as they climbed up the stairs towards the Alliance HQ.

"Until 26 December," Vlad answerd withe a smile.
"We agree to break the contract.
By the way, thank you for not commenting the process!"

Kevin and Hermione, who were the targets of that last sentence, simply swept away the thanks.
They were beginning to understand the wizarding world and they knew when to shut up.
And the first reason was when the noble aspect of the magical society intervened in the conversation.
As they did not know the magical etiquette and customs well enough, neither Kevin nor Hermione wanted to cause damage to their friends.
They thus stayed back and memorised the terms, turns of phrases, and the attitudes of everyone to get more information later.

"Did the twins leave you a message?" Neville asked Vlad as he oponed the door to their room.

Vladmir nodded and took the message from the Weasley brothers out of his pocket, reading it quickly while they all stood up around the table.
They were here to talk without fear of eavesdroppers, but they all had things to do that evening.
Homework to be at ease during the weekend, research, or a Quidditch training session in Draco's case.

"The diary disappeared," Vlad whispered.
"They did not check everywhere, but found nothing.
Ginny must have a hiding place outside the dormitory."

"Could you not find its trace?" Draco eventually asked.
"I know there are Dark magic spells to detect magical artifacts."

"I know a few spells, but they demand a lot of energy, and we're not even sure it's a magical, even if it probably is.
It's risky and I will not try anything yet," Vladmir responded.

Kervin and Hermione sighed, then announced they had to go the the Library before it closed, wanting to continue research on the Chamber of Secrets.
Draco had given them his copy of _Hogwarts: a History_ that morning, and Hermione had asked *the* question during History class to Professor Binns who was surprised of the sudden interest in his lecture.
Draco immediately followed them, pestering, as he was late for training.

Neville and Vlad, the only ones left in the Alliance HQ, looked at each other.

"Do we try today?" Neville asked.

"Yes.
The occasion is too good to pass up," the Russian agreed.
"Especially since he has a lot of questions to ask us."

"Are you sure?" 

"He tried to talk to me after class a few times.
I think our friendship and behaviour deeply intrigue him."

"We are quite the ecclectic group indeed," Neville smiled softly.
"Do you think he'd join the Alliance?
From what you told me of the meeting with Lucius Malfoy?"

Vladmir had taken the time to summarise the talk he had had over his parent's grave with Lucius, additionally destroying Draco's confidence in his mother.

"I don't know..."

They fell silent and carried on walking through the increasingly darker corridors until they got to the corridor they were looking for.

"You do the honours," Vladmir smiled, leaning on a wall.

Neville grumbled and reluctently obeyed.
He approached a door and knocked sharply several stimes before carefully stepping back.

"In or out?"

"In.
According to Draco, he's always available if you want to see him in his office."

"Well, since no one outside Slytherin would risk kocking in his door, he's relatively available."

"Nor would anybody risk themselves kocking on Professor McGonagall's door save her lions," Severus Snaped declared in a soft voice on his office's doorstep.

"Who would want to knock on this old bat's door?" Vladmir asked, wrinkling his nose.

"Not me," Neville admitted with a dusgusted grin.
Ever since they had proudly supported Vlad and Draco, the two Alliance's Gryffindors had received nothing but contempt from their Head of House, who considered their attitude as outright treason of the House's valours.

"And they say Slytherins are the most regressive ones!" Vlad sighed, shaking his head.

"Are you awared I'm here?" Snaped finally interrupted them, half-amused by their disparaging remarks about Gryffindors, half-exhasperated to be completely ignored after he had been disturbed in the middle of homework correction.

"Professor Snape, we would like to ask you a question," Neville declared, staring at the Potions Master dark eyes.

Severus Snape observed the two children in front of him.
Vladmir Kemenov was his usual self, detached and expresionless, leaning against a wall.
He knew the young heir after he had helped himduring several Occlumency lessons, and he knew how to see that shine in the emerald gaze of the one who had seemed to him like a James Potter clone.
Curiosity and a touch of worry could be percieved in those hypnotic green eyes.

Neville Longbottom, on the contrary, was far from the nervous and clumsy Gryffindor he was used to seeing.
He had begun to suspect something was up, and he now had a confirmation: that Gryffindor was in reality a Slytherin in hiding.
Everything in Neville, from his bearing, to his expressions and intonations, reminded Severus of Augusta Longbottom, the one who had met him in the _Underground_.
He was ready to bet his life that she had transmitted her assassin knowledge that had made thar family famous in the Mirage Court.

"I hope this has nothing to do with the lectures," he groaned for form.
"I would not have thought you would dare to come in the Dungeons without Mr. Malfoy."

"Draco does not know about this meeting, and I can assure you he will now," Vladmir calmly declared.

"Come in," Severus sighed, stepping aside to let the two students through.
His instincts were screaming that he would both learn and tire a lot in this discussion.

"This room is perfectly secure," Neville said after he had looked at the walls, lacking any magical protrait, and the Professor's sober and neat desk.

"This is an affirmation, not a question.
What makes you so sure?" Snaped asked, invinting them to sit in the comfortable chairs in front of him.

"No magical painting, source of the Headmaster's omnipresence, a trace of Dark magic, your sudden relaxation when you closed the door, as well as Vlad's," Neville softly stated.

"Excellent analysis," Snape said, noting the strike of surprise in Neville's eyes from his first compliment ever.
"You are right Mr Longbottom, this room is secure.
You said you had a question.
So do I, will you entertain me?"

"Yes, Professor."

"Good.
Go ahead," Snaped declared, leaning on his desk with satistaction.
He would finally have answers...

"We know you are the last of the Prince line.
Do you know about your heritage?"

"What heritage?" Severus Snape, starting to worry.
Did they know about his place in the Mirage Court?

"I am not talking about the Mirage Court," Vladmmir sighed, rolling up his sleeve to reassure the man about his intentions.
He showed his mark, as Neville did the same, making the Professor smile.
He was right.
Augusta had brilliantly taught her grandson... and how he would love to be there when the British wizarding world would learn that their Saviour, Harry Potter, the Boy-Who-Lived, was a prince of the Russian magical mafia!
James Potter was probably rolling in his grave at this point...

"We both know the Princes are a master line of the _Underground_," the Longbottom heir declared.

"Were..." Snape interrupted him.

"Were?" Neville repeated

"The _Underground_ is no more."

"Not for long," Vladmir responded.
"Voldemort disappeared, and one of the Triads is still alive.
It can rise again."

"Who?" Professor Snape asked, flabbergasted, letting his cold mask slip.
The identity of the Triads was one of the best kept secrets in the Courts.
He had nearly fallen apart when he had learned that the Triads were murdered and the _Underground_ would disappear.
It was is only family from the time he had that argument with Lily Evans, and he was torn between the hope it would rise again, and the hope it was just a bad dream.

"Their identity does not concern you," Vladmir dismissed his question.
Snape clenched his teeth, but could only comply.
He had a deep respect for the Courts' hierarchy and the few rules organizing them.
The secret of the leaders was one, and Vladmir was his superior as Prince of one of the largest Courts in the world.
He could not order him around.
It did not even cross his mind that he was their professor and he could use his authority over them.
Right now, they were all Mirages.

"What heritage are you talking about, then?" Snape finally asked.

"Something that has nothing to do with the _Underground_, and all to do with the Prince family.
Do you know where your name comes from?"

"I don't," Snape answered.
"It is an old magical line, but my grandparents disowned me at birth."

"They did not have this power," Vladmir declared with a frown.
"I am deeply surprised nobody told you."

"I don't understand what you are talking about," Snape said angrily.

He did not like to talk about his mother's family, who disonwed him as a Half-Blood, who disowned his mother when she needed their help.
And now two students barged in and said he had a right on his titles?

"Wait, do you not know the legend of the Heirs?" Neville whispered, astounded.

"Who told you you were disowned, your family?" Vlad asked plainly.

"Professor Dumbledore, when my grandfather died."

"Merlin," Neville let out, growing pale, while Vladmir was mute from astonishment.
"He dared do that?"

"Do what?" Snape exclaimed, now furious.
"Gentlemen, please explain yourselved before I get really angry!"

"Amongst the highest families of the magical nobilities, five have a particular status.
All the old families, Dumbledores including, know the rules around them.
Few people know you are a Prince, otherwise someone would have informed you of your rights...
Heirs of those families can never be disowned.
They are the Bones, Princes, Potters, Notts and Rowles.
They all have a princely title, the highest in the hierarchy.
You are in reality Prince Severus Snape, Lord Prince, as Vlad is Price Kemenov, Lord Potter."

"Why are they so special?" the Potions Master asked weakly, extremely pale.

"They are the ones who can trace their line back to Merlin and decend from the four Knight-Mages of the Round Table."

"There are five families," Snape noted.

"Indeed.
The fifth line is Artus' line.
Neville..."

The Longbottom heir sighed.
Vladmir had only one condition for his presence in the office, only one condition to reveal to him the best kept secret since Merlin's time.
He took his wand out before pointing it to his forearm.
The Potions Professor felt the magic present on the young boy's skin and frowned as he focused on Neville's pale skin.

"I swear on my magic that I will never reveal the line of descent of Artus, also known as Arthur Pendragon."

Neville's forearme glowed for a fraction of a second and briefly was draped in seven crimson lines, which made the Potions Professor jump.

"You saw them, didn't you?" Neville noted with surprise and some shame.

Snape only nodded, promissing he would not talk about it.
Indeed, he had seen the seven lines, proof that the lion kept more secrets that he had thought.
One for each Unbreakable Vow...
It was the ind of thing he should have never seen, for the young Longbottom's safety.

"Let me repeat my question," Vladmir whispered.
"Do you know the origin of your name?"

Severus Snape open his eyes wide, while his mind slowly analysed everything the boys had revealed to him.
A line was Arthur's descent, a line was entitled to the magical kingdom.
A kingdom that never was really abolished, and that could, if the heir amassed enough supporters, could be claimed...

"The Prince line...
The prince's line?"

"You are King Arthur's descendant."
