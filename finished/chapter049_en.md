# Chapter 49: Arrival of the Delegations

Vladmir was rummaging through the shelves…
_His_ shelves.
He knew exactly what he was looking for, but not how it would present itself.
because of this, he was reading over all the books present in each of the shelves of his mental library.

After he had turned over three quarters of his mind, he resolved to search a specific sector.
He had hoped he would not have to go there, but he did not have much of a choice.
Aslo, now that he thought about it, Vladmir had to admit that it was quite logical.
The parasite was holed up among his worst memories, where he went the least often.
Where its darkness would jump to him less than among the joyful moments with Nevile or Kevin.

The young Russian sighed and rubbed his arms in an unconscious reassuring gesture.
The idea to ask for Severus's help came to mind, but he pushed it back.
He would only ask when he would decide to directly face the Horcrux.
Meanwhile, he had to find it.

Slowly, he went to a particular door.
A door that Severus had helped him to close long ago.
Vladmir took a strangely-shaped key and unlocked the door.
The click rang out, he inhaled deeply, before pushing the heavy wood panel.

The shelves there, contrary to the rest of the library, were of a dark oak reflecting the darkness of the thoughts in this particular room.

Vladmir closed his eyes and let his feelings guide him.
Slowly, his hand ran along the books as he followed his instincts and his magic to detect the Dark Magic waves that would obviously emanate from the Horcrux's hiding place.

_ Big grey eyes full of suffering…
A human form severely injured, but she was innocent and it was his fault.

He winced when he started to get a few flashes of his memories.
It was one of the negative aspects of the search method, but it was the fastest, so the pros outweighted the cons.

_Burning pain…
Suffocating heat…
The wood of the wands cracked as small muticoloured explosions resulted from the destruction of the cores.
The work of a lifetime going out in flames…_

_Blond hair stained with blood.
The empty gaze as the dead body got in front of his spells, his own sobs as he held a corpse against himself in the middle of the Great Hall._

Vladmir pushed his hand away like it burned, but softly, he brushed the dark cover, and smiled slightly.
He remembered not only the dead Natashka, but her joyfulness across the Kemenov Palace.
It was this memory he cherished, not her death, and it was this one he kept in his mind.

The pain in his heart dimmed slightly, and he could go back to expliring his mind.
He ended up approaching a particular book.
His first memory…
The one that caused him, when he had been old enough to understand what happened, to swear never to cry again.
An oath that he had broken with Natashka's death, actually.

_Ginger hair on the ground. «Ma! Mama…»_

Then he felt it…
The blackness associated with one of the darkest forms of magic.
The ones touching the soul.

Vladmir opened his eyes and looked at a small book next to him.
A small book that looked familiar.
Too familiar.

"_ …mir._"

The young Russian held out his hand, trying to ingore his conscious mind screaming at him not to touch it.
Why had it taken the form of this specific diary?"

"_… ladmir._"

He was about to touch the black diary when he was forced to opened his eyes.
Panicked at being so brutally ripped from his mind, he reacted on instincts.
He hit the first face that leaned over him while feeling for his wand.

Kevin, used to fighting with his older brothers, quickly avoided this friend's punch and took it to avoid another one.
Neville, next to him, blocked Vladmir's other arm to prevent him from getting his wand.
It was better not to thing about the string of curses more dangerous than the last that Vlad would have cast on them otherwise…

"I told you he was not sleeping," Kevin grumbled.
"Vlad, calm down."

"Merlin, what…
Vladmir!" Nevilled yelled as the Russian was struggling in their hands.
Fortunately, no one else was in the Ravenclaw Common Room, because Vlad's murderous aura was terrifying, not even talking about his wild gaze.

"Occlumency," Kevin explained, thinking he had calmed his friend, not stopping to talk to him calmly, before noticing the wand in is hand.
"Shit!"

**"Vladmir Vassilievitch, please calm down!"** Neville enventually roared, avoiding the dark purple spell.

The use of his mother tongue had the desired effect, and Vladmir finally got back to earth.
Panting, his pupils dialated, he looked at his closest friends.
They were still holding him and he sighed, falling back on the settee.
Neville and Kevin released him and he put back his wand into his holster.

"Blimey, why did you interrupt me?
Is there an emergency?" the young Russian asked eventually, pushing his hair away from his face.

"The delegations are arriving in 30 minutes," Neville reminded him, "that's why we finished class early.
And grandmother will gut us if we are not there."

"You have time to take a shower and put on your uniform," Kevin chuckled.

Being ripped from his mind had made Vladmir's adrenaline spike.
The Russian was pale and his gaze was still but, but he was also sweating.

Vladmir grumbled a bit but took a shower.
When he reappeared, refreshed, his face as calm as usual, Neville and Kevin were still standing at the same spot, bue he could see a bruise on Kevin's jaw.
Mortified to have injured his friend, Vlad apologized for assaulting them.

"It's our fault," Neville eluded as Kevin was rubbin his jaw with an amused smile.
He did not see Vlad looking this much like a teenager this often.

"We should never have ripped you from such deep meditation so brutally," the Ravenclaw agreed.
"Anyway, we only have twenty minutes to get to the castle entrance…"

Thus a quarter of an hour later, Vladmir was standing among the other Hogwarts students at the castle entrance.
The staff had gathered them in front of the bridge of honour spanning over the tipe of the Black Lake, at the point where the waters of Scotland's streams flowed to feed the lake.
This bridge joined the entrance to the castle to the monumental gates of the Hogwarts domain.
It was also at this place that the first years disembarked after their boat ride.

The Prefects had alligned the Hogwarts students in perfect files, by House then year, and they stood up straight, subjected to the last pieces of advice on the importance of diplomacy with their guests and the last corrections.

"Weasley, hat straight," Professor McGonagall said dryly to Ronald.

Hermione rolled her eyes when her friend struggled to straighten his hat, making Neville, right behind her, smile, before also straightening his collar.

"Miss Patil, please remove this ridiculous accessory," the Transfiguration Professor added for Padma's twin.
Padma sighed, mumbling something about false twins while Parvati was removing a hideous velvet butterfly from her hair.

"Seriously, I don't know what we have in common," the young girl whispered, the other fourth-year Ravenclaws quitely supporting her.
Indeed, day after day, they could clearly see the differences in mentality and behaviour between the two twins.

"How will they arrive?" Kevin enventually asked Vladmir, who sighed when all the other Ravenclaws turned to him, waiting.

"Why are you asking me?"

"Well, I'm sure you know Durmstrang students," Micheal smiled.

"They will come by boat," Vlad sighed, before adding that Durmstrang was on an island to respind to their surprised faces.

"By boat?" Mandy repeated, incredulous.

"What about the French schools?" Anthony asked.

"I don't know?"

"Train?"

"I don't think so.
Far too common when you know Beauxbâtons' reputation for ostentation."

"Apparition?"

"You can't Apparate inside Hogwarts' premises," Padma smiled.

The group of Ravenclaws was carefully looking at the park, which was growing darker.
All the students were doing the same, waiting in heavy silence.
The October cold was starting to be felt, and while Vladmir was not incommodated at all ‑ it was 10 degrees above his cold detection threshold ‑ the others were starting to shiver…

… Until a soft warmth evenlopped all the Ravenclaws.
They all thanked with a nod their Head of House, who was looking at them kindly.
Professor Flitwick had just cast a small warming spell so that their teeth would not chatter in front of their guests.
The other Heads of Houses quickly did the same, and many students sighed in relief.

Luna, next to Kevin but in hte third-year ranks, was the first one to raise her head towards the Forbidden Forest, probably warned by her natural talent for foresight.

"There!" a young Gryffinodr student suddenly yelled, whom Vladmir had noticed had eagle eyes and who generally had a camera with him.
Colin Crivey, if he remembered correctly.

Indeed, above the Forbidden Forest, something huge appeared, something growing while it approached ‑ and quickly at that.

"A dragon?" a Ravenclaw asked with curiosity, while several Hufflepuff were showing signs of fear.

"Don't say nonsense, Miss Chang," Severus warned, approaching them with Professor Flitwick.

But it was not reassuring for the other students.
They wary looks were still locked on the house/thing that flew towards them.

Kevin gave his sister a reassuring smile, ten metres or so away.
She was quickly learning the Slytherin policy, and only his perfect knowledge of Mary-Ann made him see she was worried.
The young Entwhistle gave him a smile back, as Leonis leaned towards her to whisper something in her ear.

"My little lion takes care of her," Luna declared, looking at her cousin.

"I know," Kevin sighed, "but…"

"You are worried about her.
The Fayes watch over her, more than over you, and you are quite protected.
And she is under the protection of the dragon, so she has nothing to fear."

"Thank you little fairy," Kevin said sincerely, only getting a soft smile in return.

"Walk back slightly, please!" Professor Sprout suddenly demanded.

All the students obeyed, especially when what was revealed to be a huge carriage drawn by absurdly-sized pegasi dived towards them.

The Headmistress and the four Heads of Houses, placed themselves in front of the students to welcome their guests when the carriage landed.

The noise was loud, and it raised a thick cloud of dust that Augusta made disappear with a flick of her wand.
The Beaxbâtons coat-of-arms, two crossed golden wands casting three stars each, were revealed on the door.

The Hogwarts Keeper of the Keys and Grounds appeared and opened the impressive door while placing steps, before disappearing again, as was appropriate for a simple servant.
Wizarding etiquette was what it was, the old rules were still in use for many things, including the importance on making the servants as discreet as possible…

Professor Prince was the one to walk to the carriage to galantly help a beautiful woman whose size explained the dimension of the cabin.
After bowing, he held out his arm to her to guide her towards the Hogwarts Headmistress.

"Giant," Kevin whispered.

"Only partly, I think," Anthony agreed behind him.
"Like Professor Hagrid."

"She is way more charming than him," Padma giggled.

Indeed, apart from being impressively tall, she had a stately demeanour, fascinating black eyes, and an undeniably noble craggy face, and that was reinforced by her austere black dress delicately enhanced by opals.

Augusta slightly bowed her head, impreceptible greeting that the giantess gave back.

"Dame Maxime, bienvenue au Domaine de Poudlard.
Que votre séjour soit prospère et sous la bénédiction de la Magie," Augusta added in French [1]

"Je vous remercie de votre accueil, ma chère Lady Longbottom," Dame Maxime smiled back.
"Que la Magie vous soit favorable." [2]

"Vlad, translation," Kevin whispered.

"They have just exchanged the typically french welcoming words," the Russian whispered back, not looking away from the two Headmistresses.

"You understand French?" Lisa wondered, right in front of Vladmir.

"No, but I know basic etiquette in three quarters of European countries.
The French are the most strict about etiquette," Vlad whispered.

"Let me introduce you to the Hogwarts students, dear," the Longbottom Matriarch continued, gesturing towards the nearly two hundred students of her school.
"Youngsters, please welcome Dame Olympe Maxime, Headmistress of the prestigeous Beauxbâtons and Rochefroide Academines."

To Augusta satisfaction, none of herstudents applauded, and the boys bowed with a hand on their heards, while the girls did a delicate curtsey.
Professor Selwyn had gone through all the Common Rooms to teach them the basics of the French etiquette to avoid any faux-pas.
The French might be more open about blood and magic matters, but they were still sticklers about nobility and etiquette.
This attention seemed to impress the French Headmistress, who turned to Augusta.

"I did not know that you were teaching your students etiquette," Dame Maxime wondered with a thick accent.

"The Initiation to Wizarding Culture lectures were reintroduced nearly two years ago," Augusta explained with a smile.

"Then let me introduce to my own students," Dame Maxime declared softly.

As of the Rochefroide and Beauxbâtons were waiting for this signla, two ranks of young adults, all more than seventeen years old, stepped out in perfectly aligned ranks.

The dozen students all wore light blue sliken uniforms, and as they were introduced, they bowed in turn.

"I thought that there were three champions, but that's four schools," Lisa mumbled, one of the Ravenclaws in their year.

"Listen in class," Michael chuckled.
"They are the same school, it is just not mixed.
They have two separate facilities!"

"Would you like to enter to get warmer?" Augusta asked in the meantime, noticing that the French students seemed chilled to the bone, too lightly clothed for the Scottish cold.

"I thank you for the attention, but we will wait for Headmaster Karkaroff and his students to arrive," the Giantess smiled affably.
"If I am not mistaken, they should be here shortly."

"Indeed.
Professor Hagrid?"

"Yes, Headmistress?"

The half-giant and Professor of Care of Magical Creatures arrived behind them and softly patted the gigantic pegasi, before bringing them with the carriage towards the Forbidden Forest, under the worried gaze of the French Headmistress.

"Do not worry dear," Augusta smiled, "we have taken into account all your demands concerning the treatment of your stallions, and Professor Hagrid is the one best suited to take care of them.
You are of course invited to see them in the stables as often as you would like."

We have stable?" Ron grumbled in the Gryffindor rank.

"Of course idiot," Hermione mumbled, "they are next to the east winf and overlook the moor.
Where do you think the Thestrals are housed all year long?"

"Thestrals?" Ron repeated.

"We will explain it later," Neville whispered, amused.
Hermione had been calling Ron an idiot for quite a long time, and it would probably stick, especially when he repeated the young girl's explanations.

As the two ranks of French students were settling next to the British students, a strange noise came from the darkness.
Only the courtyard and the bridge were lit up by lanterns, the rest of the park was now fully dark.

"They are coming," Vladmir smiled.

"The lake, look at the lake!" Lee Jordan, the Wealsey twins' closest friend, exclaimed.

Indeed, less than a hundred metres away from the small quay, large bubbles had appeared.
In a few seconds, they were replaced by a whirlpool, and in the middle, a mast was slowly rising.

Whispers rose up as an impressive ship emerged from the warts, deploying its sails to do the rest of the way to the quay.
Contrary to the Beauxbâtons and Rochefroide bright carriage, the Durmstrang ship was dark, dim greenish lights shone through the portholes.
The symbol of the Belarussian school was clearly visible on the sails, and two men jumped to the ground to moor the ship and deploy a ramp with a flick of their wands.

A man got out, wearing a fur coat as white as his hair.
Only Kevin saw the wild look Vladmir gave the man, and he promised himself to snoop around to understand his friend's anger.

Behind the unknown man, twenty or so young men with deep purple fur caps deployed on the ship's deck, but not stepping down.
Their appearance was martial, especially with the ceremonial sabres they were wearing on their waists and that reflected the lantern flames.

"Lady Longbottom!" the man exclaimed warmly, walking towards the Headmistresses.
"And dear Dame Maxime!
How are you, Ladies?"

"As fine as possible, Professor Karkaroff," Augusta replied with a cold smile.

"As good as can be, Professor", Olympe Maxime nodded.
It was not diffucult to see that, contrary to the Hogwarts Headmistress, she was not making an effort to be friendly.

"I must have missed something," Kevin mumbled, "because they sure don't seem to like him."

"Karkaroff is a Death Eater," Vlad whispered, "and he is openly racist."

"Oh, that explains it," the Muggle-Born nodded.
"How come he is free?"

Kevin's question was full of sarcasme.
He knew that the wizarding world was rotten, but seeing a Death Eater leading a school was on another level, even after what he had already seen.

"He was a witness against his former allies during his trial.
His sentence was greatly reduced thankgs to that.
He only spent one year in Azkaban."

"Headmaster Karkaroff, let me introduce you to the whole Hogwarts student body," Lady Longbottom declared suddenly.
"Youngsters, this is Igor Karkaroff, Headmaster of the famous Durmstrang school."

Igor Karkaroff's gaze went over the ranks of the Hogwarts students, before stopping on Vladmir's eyes.
He stayed frozen for a fraction of a second, slightly pale, especially when the Russian gave him a mocking smile.
Although he was only in shock for a fraction of a second, but it was enough for some people to notice, including the French Headmistress, who gave him a pointed look, as well as the Slytherins and a few Ravenclaws.
Igor Karkaroff quickly regained his composure and introduced his own students.

In a perfectly coordinated movement, the students stepped down from the ship and aligned themselves in front of the others, as the French delegation had done a few minutes earlier.

"What a joy to be here, really," Headmaster Karkaroff sighed, observing the castle.
"Viktor, come warm up a bit…
I hope it does not bother you, Lady Longbottom?
Viktor is suffering from a cold…"

It highly bothere the Longbottom Matriarch, especially this last faux-pas.
No one had missed it, even the Hogwarts Muggle-Borns.
The man was imposing himself without having been invited first, and the looks he got from the two Headmistresses were outright hostile.

Whisperes rose up when one of the Belarussian students, although strategically placed in the back of the ranks, stepped forward reluctantly.
Viktor Krum, the most famous Seeker, the one who allowed the Bulgarian team to reach the Quiddtich World Cup final, was among the Durmstrang delegation.
In the whispers around him, Vlad noted that they all thought that the Bulgarian man was done with school.

"Hermione…
That's Krum!"

Kevin held back a mocking giggle as he hear Ron uselessly scream in the Gryffindor ranks.
As the delegations, after Augusta's former invitation, as well as the Hogwarts students started to go to the castle, Vladmir saw a familiar face.

"Come Kevin," Vlad whispered, before motioning for Draco, Cedric and Neville to follow hil.

As the Headmaster and Headmistresses advised all to warm up in the castle, the small group made their way towards the Russian delegation and Vladmir, a sincere smile in his face, went to a tall blonde man with two large light, nearly-transparent, blue eyes.

**"Vladmir Vassilievitch Kemenov?"** the student exclaimed in a tenor voice quite far from what could be expected of his frail appearance.
**"Give me a hug, Tsesarevitch Vladmir!"**

**"Aleksei Lyvonevitch Vesafine, it is a pleasure to see you again!"**

The two Russians hugged amicably and shook each other's hand.

**"My friends, let me introduce you to one of my oldest comrades, Aleksei Lyvonevitch Vesafine,"** Vladmir declared, not realizing that he was still speaking Russian.
**"I told you about him Kevin, he was the one I raced on broom over the Neva under the Muggles' noses!"**

**"My sympathies,"** Kevin chuckled at Aleksei.
**"Katya Annapovna can really be terrifying whe she want to."**

**"I know,"** the Russian shivered, remembering the severe punishment they got afterwards.
**"And you never met my mother…"**

**"Kevin Warren Entwhistle,"** the Ravenclaw introduced himself.

**"Welcome to Hogwarts," Neville greeted before introducing himself, followed closely by Draco.
Only Cedric stayed silent, but game the other students a slightly cringing smile.
After all, he did not understand a single word of Vladmir's mother tongue, contrary to the others.

"Let's use English," Vladmir realized, apologeticilly looking a Cedric.
However, he latter did not react, far too focused on the arrival of a star close to him.
Indeed, Viktor Krum was calmly approaching, as Igor Karkaroff was storming towards the castle.

"Ah, Viktor, let me introduce you to…"

"Vladmir Vassilievitch Kemenov.
We have already met," the Bulgarian Seeker declared with a sorry smile, shaking Vlad's hand.

"When?" Aleskei asked.

"During a Flightracing event," Vladmir smiled.

"And during the Quidditch World Cup opening match," Krum laughed.
"We made quite a few hearts skip a bit when we exchanged brooms."

"Well, one had to spice it up," Vlad chuckled, before looking towards the castle.
"You frustraded your Headmaster.
Differing opinions?"

"Outside the fact that you are Tsesarevitch of Russia, the old man is overprotecting me like like Baba Yaga, if you know what I mean."

Vladmir gave me an understanding smile.
Baba Yaga was one of the witches of the Russian folklore, as mythical as the Peverell brothers of the British.
She had several stories about her.
A bogeywoman capturing children to eat them, she was also known to raise and fatten them before slaughtering them.
Apparently, Karkaroff only wanted glory and prestige by overprotecting the Bulgarian Seeker.

"You want to participate in the tournament, vesafine?" Cedric asked, interested.

"Of course!
Even if I don't have much of a chance against the mean machine!" the Russian joked, giving his Bulgarian friend a small elbow nudge.
"What about you?"

The five Hogwarts students looked at each other.

"Unfortunately, we are too young to participat," Neville sighed with a fakely regretful face that did not fool any one.
"However, we have our own mean machine, don't we Cedric?"

The Hufflepuff blushed slightly, as Draco added.

"After all, he has had the same path as Mr. Krum here," the Slythrin cuckled.
"He is a Seeker, admired by the ladies, and major of his year…"

"You are wrong there, Malfoy," Aleksei sniggered.
"Viktor is far from leading the school rankings, whatever Karkarof does…"

"Training comes at the coest of classes," Krum whinced.

"Is it alright if you continue the conversation inside?" a new voice asked softly.

The seven students turned to face Hermione and Luna, the former's wild hair making her seem strangely supernatural in the night while Luna's usual paleness made her seem nearly inhuman.

"Every one is inside," Luna declared in her dreamy tone, before turning a thoughful and very serious gaze to Aleksei.
"You should be with your kind.
The Fates are watching and the Demons is waiting for a single misstep.
Ask for the Emperor's support."

On those sibyline words, Luna took Hermione's arm and without waiting any more, turned to the school.
All students had indeed disappeared into the castle, even the few unconditional fans of Viktor Krum who had waited for a few minutes in the hops to see the world vice-champion climbing the steps to the Entry Hall.

The two Russians frowned, but followed the rest of the small group.
While the others knew about Luna's gift, it was not the case for Krum and Vesafine.

**"Is she prescient?"**

**"She has the gift,"** Vladmir nodded.

**"Then I must get in touch with my family, immediately,"** Aleksei whispered.

**"Trouble with clan Davonine, recently?"**

Aleksei simply nodded, then held back Vladmir as the others had a head start.
The Dlavonine name literally mean "demon's clan' and they were one of the most powerful Russian clans, not very far behind the Kemenovs.

**"As heir to hte Vesafines, I request the protection of clan Kemenov,"** the Russian wizard murmured.

**"A clan war?"** Vladmir whispered back in worry.

**"Dlavonines have views on our mineral resource in East Siberia.
They have tried to buy them three times those last few months, but my father refused all,"** Aleksei whispered.

Vladmir looked at his friend intensely, his mind working overtime.
Vesafines were one of the rare wizarding families to own land rich in magical gold.
Most of the Siberian mines were owned by Goblins, especially the Bledors, but Aleksei's family had one of the largest deposits.

The clan was not that powerful, its wealth only coming from those mines, and they could not sell them without disappearing.
Vladmir knew Kyvon Antonovitch Vesafine.
Aleksei's father had his pride, which had prevented him for asking for protection.
Pride that his son and heir did not share.
Especially when the Dlavonines were involved.

**"You know what you are asking?"** Vladmir asked for the peace of his mind.

It was not rare for less important clans to ask for the protection of bigger clans.
But those were never free, or they would be alliances.
Knowing his aunt and her friendship with Aleksei's mother, the cost would not be too high, but it would probably involve a percentage of the gold selling profits…

**"I will deliver your request to the Kemenov matriarch,"** Vladmir sighed when his friend nodded.
**"Stay with me after the end of the meal, we will get in touch with Katya and Lyvon."**

He could see relief in Aleksei's face as they joined their friends, who were waiting for them in the Entry Hall.

"We will have everyone's attention on us," Draco sighed, noticing the doors of the Great Hall ajar.

"Don't tell me you don't like it," Hermione sighed.

"I am…"

"A Malfoyf, we know," the yong witch interrupted, making their friends laugh.
"But I would like avoiding the attention!"

"Says Gryffindor's Ms Know-it-all?
That's rich," the Slytherin took offence.

"Children, calm down," Neville sighed.

"Yes mom," Draco chuckled.
"Miss Granger, will you give me the honour?"

Hermione rolled her eyes before accepting Draco's arm and straightening up slightly, adopting a better bearing.
If they had to have a remarkable entry, might as well make it royal.
Behind her, Luna had taken Vladmir's arm without asking, making him sigh.

"Luna…"

"Shush, I'm admiring the little Iechenkas who came with our Eastern friends.
They only go out at night… and I forgot my camera in my room," the Ravenclaw girl complained.

Vladmir complained despite hisemf at her incredible knowledge of rare creatures from all over the world, then guided Luna inside the Great Hall.
Immediately, every one's attention got on them, including the Hogwarts' Headmistress's.

"Mister Kemenov, I don't doubt that you have not seen some friends for a long time, but it is not a reason to make the whole school wait!" Augusta snaped from the Professors' table.

Vladmir barely avoided whincing and simply apologized in a clear voice, before joining the Ravenclaw table with Luna and Kevin.
The two members of the Durmstrang delegation followed Draco to the Slytherin table, where the representatives of the Belarusian school were sitting down.
Many girls were drooling over the Quidditch player, which did not seem to move Krum, and it made the Slytherins snigger.

Luna, Kevin, and Vladmir found a place besides a group of French witches and sat down.
The two girls carefully observed one of the girls, incredibly blonde, her hair nearly silver, and whose eyes were a dark blue.

**"Veela?"** Kevin guessed.

**"Probably.
You only need to see how much Anthony is drooling over her,"** Vlad joked, pointing to their Housemate who was totally entranced.

"If I may, what are two Russians doing in Hogwarts?" the young woman in question asked sudenly with a thick accent and a bright smile.
Far too bright to be human.

"You may, but we can simply not answer," Kevin smiled affably.
"Especially since we have not been introduced yet."

The way the French witch's face hardened was hilarious and quite interesting, esepcially when she revealed white teeth way too sharp to be human.

"Being a Veela does not mean that your charms work on all men and spares you from having some etiquette.
Your father would be furious at your lack of manners if he heard about it," Luna declared calmly, helping herself to some stew.
"After all, the Delacours are one of the oldest noble families in France."

Neither Kevin nor Vladmir knew whether they should burst out laughing at the offended face the French woman had at the small Ravenclaw for the telling-off, or if they should be worried at the suddenly clear tirade.
Where was their dreamy and softly crazy Luna?
It was rare that she was so clear and normal, and it was generally a bad sign.

"How…"

"Veela are not the only magical creatures compatible with humans."

"Dryad," the French woman spewed out quite unelegantly.

Vladmir and Luna turned to face the Veela, interposing themselves between her and Luna.
If the latter had Dryad blood, it explained the softness and the soft madness of the Lovegoods, as well as her gift for perceiving supernatural beings.
She was bound to nature more closely than most wizards and witches.

"Hurt a single hair off her head, Delacour, and I will not be able to ensure your future," Kevin whispered.

"Who are you to threaten me?" the Veela took offence.

"Vladmir Vassilievitch Kemenov, Prince Potter and Tsesarevitch of the Russian Empire," the Russian told her amicably.

"Kevin Entwhistle, Knight-Mage of Prince Potter.
Luna Lovegood is under my protection."

While Vladmir had strongly insisted on his accent, Kevin's voice had taken the hissing intonations of Parsletongue, and his eyes had become as cold as Siberian ice.
Kevin did not know exactly why he had said that, but the French witch's reaction was rather surprising.

She grew pale, as did her friends, before slightly bowing down in front of them.

"I did not want to dishonour your Lady, Lord Entwhistle, not damage your name, Prince Potter."

"What just happened?" Kevin whispered as the three French women stepped away from them, the whole Great Hall looking at them.
Apart from a few Ravenclaws around them, no one had realized that a serious diplomatic incident had just been avoided.

"You have just threatened the heir of one of the oldest noble French families without repercussion, since the French magical world is under the authority of the English magical crown," Vlad giggled as Luna was smiling softly at him, stars in her eyes.
"By the way, you have just implicitly declared that Luna was your fiancée."

Kevin froze, looked at him with wide eyes, and moaned.

"My gallant knight," Luna giggled, teasing him.

"I am cursed," the Muggle-Born whinged, making everyone around laugh out loud.

"Who are the other three people around the table?" kevin asked slowly, still annoyed, his attention focused on the Professors' table.

Vladmir turned his head and squinted his eyes.
The first one's face was vaguely familiar, he definitely knew the second one because it was Damocles Rowe, and as for the third, the traits were distinctive.
And him belonging to that family was strengthened when he was sitting down nect the Initiation to Wizarding Culture professor.
He was a Selwyn.
He informed his friend, who spent the rest of the meal speculating on their presence, some being quite idiotic, but they made every one laugh.

As the meal was ending on a number of cakes and biscuits, some unknown, Augusta stood up with a smile on her face.

"Youngsters, it is time to officially open this 25th Tri-Wizard Tourament.
However, before all else, please let me introduce you to the new Head of the Departement of International Magical Cooperation, Lord Damocles Rowle, his ministerial aid, Felix Selwyn, and last but not least, Ludo Bagman, Head of the Department of Magical Games and Sports.

Polite clapping greeted the first two wizards who simply nodded.
The claps were more enthusiastic for the third one.

"Bagman…
Wasn't he the World Cup final's commentator?" Kevin asked.

"He was, and he also is a former Beater for the English team.
A good one, even," Vlad declared, finally understanding why he looked familiar.

"Lord Rowle having taken the lead of the Department in such shrot notice, he will not be able to take part in the jury like was initially planned.
Mister Selwyn will thus take over this duty.
He, along with Mister Bagman, Dame Maxime, Professor Karkaroff and myself, will be the jury for the three tasks of the tournament.

"I was wondering…
Why Dame Maxime?" Kevin whispered.

"Dame is the French equivalent for Lady, Sire is the equivalent of Lord," his friend replied.

Meanwhile, the Headmistress had explained the different tasks.
In the respectful silence of the Great Hall, she took out her wand and waved it in front of her to materialize a huge chest at the foot of the Professor's stage.
An ancient chest with inlaid precious games buzzing with magic.

"As you know, three champions will be named, one per participating school.
During each task, they will receive marks depending on their performance, and the total marks will determine the winer.
The three champions will be chosen by an impartial judge, which has chosen since the beginning of the Tournament…
The Goblet of Fire!"

Augusta tapped on the lid three times, and she took out a magnificient cup.
The material was strange, seemingly alive, and impressive blue flames were coming out of it.

"It's wood," Luna whispered.
"Ancient and magical wood.
Very powerful."

Even if Vlamdir and Kevin still doubted that Luna had some link to Dyads, it not not possible any more.
Not many wizards or witches could recognize the wood so quickly, amuch less detect the magical power.

"Whomever wants to submit their candidacy must put a piece of parchment with their name and school written legibly inside of the goblet.
You have 24 hours from now to do so.
Tomorrow evening, for the day of the dead, the Goblet will name the champions it will have assesed as worthy to represent their schools.
You have been told about the formalities of a candidacy, so I will not repeat them.
Simply know that once you put your name in the goblet, you sign a magical contract.
Be sure of your decision.

On this last warning, Augusta wished them a good night and dismissed them.

<hr>

The evening was intense for many people.
While most of the Hogwarts residents were excited about the tournament, some had bigger worried.

Vlamdir had just contacted Katya and the head of the Vesafine clan to start negociations to get the protection of clan Kemenov.
Somwhere in the castle, a tyoung French witch was sending her family a letter to tell them about the return of the Five Families, and the direct insult she had given to one of the Potters' wards.
A former Death Weater was worried about his life after he had seen a Kemenov ‑ and not any Kemenov, but the heir of the Romanovs…

And because the evening was busy, the start of the night was calm.
Neville made the most of it to work calmly on a new type of poison, settled in one of the comfortable chairs of the Gryffindor Common Room.
While he seemed like a walking catastrophy in Potions classes, only his friends and Professor Prince knew that he was good.
After all, knowing poisons so well necessitated a knowledge of their antidotes, most of them potions.
Members of the Mister Line of Longbottom, specialized in poisons, were genious Botanists and good potionists.

Thus, at two in the morning, he had taken out his notebook charmed with dozens of protection spells and was scribbling ideas for combinations to create a new poison.
The last one had been invented by his great-grandfather, and he needed a new one without a known antidote…

Neville was thus thinking about the magical properties of cyanide, too well known and thus underestimated in poisonings, when something tourbled him.
Quickly closing his notebook, he realized that footsteps could be heard in the dormitory stairs.
It was rare for any student to get up in the middle of the night, especially a Saturday morning…

Carefully, slipping his wand in his hand discreetly, he feigned sleep, watching for the coming person through his eyelashes.

The wild brown hair only meant one person…
Neville sat up and realized, astounded that his friend's chocolate eyes were glassy, as she was walking in front of him without seeing him.

"Hermione?"

She did not answer, walking silently.
As she was going to the exit, Neville noted her bare feet, the thin nightgown that would get her killed if she went through the cold corridors.

But the main problem were her glassy eyes…
Too many things could be the reasons…
Ffrom simple sleepwalking to the Imperius curse see in class…
And in any of those case, it was not a good idea to rip someone from that state of transe.

Neville got the Alliance's Galleon and rang the alarm.

It went through the school's dormitories, for the first time since the Alliance had been created.
Something was wrong.

The Weasley twins, who were calmly snoring, piled up in the same bed as per their usual since childhood, jumped.
Without trying to understand, only understanding that it was the Alliance's Galleon sounding, they rose up at once.
In the haste, the bumped each other painfully, but did not make a fuss about it…
They took their wands and ran towards the door.

"Guys?" their best friend asked, his voice sleepy.

"Go back to sleep Lee," Fred whispered.

"Nothing serious," George added.

However, Lee knew them too well to be had.
Seeing them wearing long johns running down the stairs wand in hand was not something that was warrented if there was 'nothing serious'.
However, he trusted them too much.
If they did not need him, he would not follow them…
It had been a year since they started have their little secrets, and when they wanted to, they would share it…
But something was undeniably wrong.

Draco sharply opened his eyes, too used to the rude awakenings that Mary-Ann had started when joining Slytherin.
He cursed the rules allowing the girls to sneak into the boys' dormitories…
Except that the young girl was not jumping over him, smiling, accomanied by her dormitory friends.
Only a brutal alarm that, had he not cast privacy charms, would have woken up his friends.

In one swift motion, he pushed the covers and took the Galleon on his bedside table and simply Transfigured his luxurious pajamas into black trousers and a thick jumper.
Then he took his family's wand and sneaked out.

He missed Theo's and Blaise's worried looks.
Contrary to what Draco believed, he had forgotten to cast privacy charms on his bed.
Only Crabbe and Goyle, who were able to sleep with screaming banshees surronding them, were still sleeping.

Severus, despite the late hour, was not sleeping.
In the laboratories of the Chamber of Secrets, he was finishing up the Wolfsbane potion for Lupin, chatting with André about the properties of certain plants.

The alarm took them both by surprise, and André nearly fell from the Potions Master's head directly into the boiling potion.
Only Severus's relfexes saed him from a painful bath.

Cursing, Severus did not hesitate and abandonned his potion.
Because if the Galleon was ringing, it was because on of his wards was probably in danger.
In one flick, he made the liquid disappear, since he could not put the Woolfsbane potion into stasis at this point of the preparation.

Fawkes, who had been half-asleep on a shelf, perched on the wizard's shoulder immediately.
Professor Prince was particularly threatening when he disappeared from the Chamber of Secret with Andrade Slytherin on his head and Fawkes in his shoulder.
He simply had to follow the Galleon, which would lead directly to the one who started the alarm.

Cedric was having a delightful dream focused on his girlfriend, when a quite nasty noise woke him up.
Completely disorientated, he only needed a few seconds to realized that if he did not know that noise, it was because he had never heard it before…
Fortunately, the Alliance's Galleon was also shining an alarming red.

Mumbling about the perks of being a Prefect and having his own room, Cedric took some trousers, a shirt and his robes before going to the door.

Silently crossing his Common Room, he had to hid behind a particularly bushy vine while his female counterpart was disappearing into her own room.
He could then sneak into the secret tunnel leading to the kitchens.
His friends needed him.

Mary-Ann opened her eyes, convinced that Draco had finally decided to get revenge for his rude awakenings.
She finally could pull the pranks she always wanted to do on her brothers, and the tall blond was her favourite target, along with Neville.

"What's that noise," Clarisse mumbled, her first and best friend.

"My brother needs to talk to be," Mary-Ann lied shamelessly.
Although it was not really a lie, since she would join him soon.

"At this time?" the young Selwyn asked, raising her eyebrows after she saw the clock showing two in the morning.

Mary-Ann gave her a sorry smile then took a jumper and her school robes, which she pushed over her nightgown.

Clarisse looked at her stand up and get old jeans, then sighed before searching under her pillow.

"Here, Pap…"

Mary-Ann caught the object by reflex, long and thin and looked, surprised, at her roommate, fortunately the only other girl in Slytherin in her year.

"It's my grandmother's wand.
Make sure you give it back."

Mary-Ann gave her a bright smile and jumped on Clarisse to joyfully kiss her.

"Thank you!"

And Mary-Ann disappeared after putting the Galleon in her pocket, her friend worrying for her.
It was not a secret for any Slytherin that the Ravenclaw Gemini and the Gryffindor twins were not a legal group.
Was Pap linked to it?

Kevin and Vlamdir simultaneously opened their eyes… only to get face-to-face with a small blonde Ravenclaw who was already awake and apparently in great form.

"Hermione is going to meet a Dragon," the young girl was jumping up and down.
Her earrings, this time made of dafodil, were catching the night Vlamdir had just lit up.

Without trying to understand more, the two boys took their wands and jumped out of bed.
They only knew about one dragon in Hogwarts…
And Hermione was capable to wake it up without wanting.
Whoever activated the alarm was definitely right.
