# Chapter 40: Fugitives

The Hogwarts Staff Room was a warm place, not organized for work, but for relaxation.
It had a huge relaxation spot, with a large chimney, and colorful rugs made the whole thing welcoming.
A large table could host staff meetings, and was placed in a corner of the room.
Of course, most Hogwarts Professors marked their papers on this common desk, which hundreds of them had used before.

Contrary to the conventional wisdom that they preferred to be alone in their offices, most of the teaching staff like to meet together.
They lived for nearly ten months in the castle, and the Staff Room was like their personnal Common Room.

The only things that differed with the Common Rooms were the boards, and the door leading directly to the Library.

The latter was a priviledge awarded to the Professors.
They could access it at will since the new Headmistress had taken office.
The day after her appointment, Augusta had asked Hogwarts to create a door betwwen the two rooms, even if they were on totally opposite places of the castle.
According to her, for her teaching staff to say the best, they had to regularly update their lectures.
And to update them correctly, they had to have unlimited access to the Library without having to walk through the whole castle.

As for the boards covering the whole length of awall, they had two purposes, both essential.
They allowed staff to follow the number of House points, along with the punishments, the students names, and the academic rankings.

Unsuprisingly, the Weasley twins were ahead in both punishment amount, and number of points lost, all Houses and years combined.
However, others were more surprising, like Penelope Clearwater and Percy Weasley, Head Girl and Head Boy respectively, who got a detention for inappropriate behaviour in the corridors.

The main purpose of those large boards, however, were the announcement system.
A board dedicated to each professor signaled them that a student was in front of their office.
In a few seconds, they could get to the room through the internal Floo network.
Professors Sprout's, Flitwick's, McGonagall's and Prince's  boards also had another alert.
A portrait in each Common Room allowed the students to request their Head of House's presence, and when there was a problem in theor respective Common Room, magical alerts activated.

On a Saturday Morning like all others, Professors Selwyn, Prince and Sinistra each had their occupation: respectively marking papers, reading the latest issue of the 'International Potionist' journal, and preparing a sky map for the nect month.
Apart from the fire crackling in the hearth, only the sounds of quills scratching on parchment and the pages turning broke the silence in the Staff Room.

Marcus Selwyn had the papers from his two gems.
The Pure-Blood described himself as a traditionalist, affiliated to the Conservatives, one of the most important wizarding political movements in the Wizengamot, and he had quite an entrenched opinion of Muggle-Borns.
He did not like them for a simple reason.
THey did not know the magical world, and did not try to learn about it.

For geenrations, the Selwyn minor branch had specialized in education.
They thus had a painful awareness of what was wrong in the wizarding world.
However, the control some had on school made any attempt to change things very tedious.

Thus, when Lord Malfoy had presented two unknown children at the Saturnalia, Marcus Selwyn had be susprised.
He was one of the three representatives from the Selwyn House, one for each branch, and he had been worried of both the reactions form his House, as well as the children's future;
While the main branch, very Conservative or even Death Eater, were offended by the presentation of two children coming out of the blue in Pure-Blood society, the senior line, who was totally neutral in principle, had been quite favourable to it.

Marcus Selwyn had then felt like it was a warning of changes to come when he had realised that those two children, presented along wiht the future Potter, Malfoy, and Logbottom Lords, were mere Muggle-Borns.
Thus when Augusta Longbottom asked the Head of his family for help with shaping the teaching to future generations in the pretigious Hogwarts school, he had volunteered to the Initiation to Wizarding Culture Professor position without hestitation.

And he had realized that both of those promissing children went way beyond his expectations.

Hermione Granger and Kevin Entwhistle were real gems.
Their knowledge were equivalent to many Pure-Bloods, maybe even far more extensive.
Marcus Selwyn had a thought about the deplorable manners the youngest Weasley male displayed, and thought that the matriarchs of the two noble families, the very conservative Contess Cederella Weasley, née Black, and the quite severe Baroness Muriel Prewett were probably disappointed by the youngest two.
Thankfully, Arthur's eldest sons were well-mannered, and ready to take over the two earldoms…

However, more than the rest, Professor Selwyn had noticed an essential detail, very recent.
He was sure that most students did not know the meaning of the tatoo on Entwhistle's forearm.
The young boy did not hide it, but he stayed silent and humble, which made sure only a shrewd eye could see the intricate pattern inscribed in his skin.
The signification could only please him, and the Selwyn patriarch was deligthed when Marcus had told him.

Some one had bestowed a title to Kevin Entwhistle.
He had become the first Knight-Mage since Merlin, unsurprisingly becoming a vassal to Prince Potter.
The time of the Five Families finally seemed to be coming.

Marcus Selwyn looked at his Astronomy colleague, still in her maps, then his Potions Master friend, focused on his reasing.

"Lord Prince?"

Severus, who was calmly reading his journal, his mind far from his colleague's worries, raised his head warily.

"Seigneur Selwyn," he answered formally, trying to hide his curiosity.
It was rare that Marcus, whom he had learned to know quite well since he had arrived, was so insistant on titles between staff members.

"I noticed a new Knight-Mage appeared to the service of the Potter Princedom.
Should we expect a return of the Monarchy?"

Over the table, Professor Sinistra made a surprised noise, but she stayed silent, staring at Severus with wide eyes.

The Potions Master calmly closed his journal and stood up, giving his colleagues a smile.
He then sat down at the end of the table and look at them intensely.

"Knight-Mage Entwhistle-Potter swore an oath indeed.
However, I doubt this is the only reason for your question."

Marcus, in turn, also had an amused smile.
The reason was obvious.
He knew the dark and laconic Severus Tobias Snape by reputation.
Antisocial, withdrawn…
He also knew that he was Eileen Prince's son.
He had thought, like many other people, that the man was ashamed of his Half-Blood status, and had not taken back the name of his line.
Now, the thought that there was some deeper thing under this appearance.
One did not change as drastically in merely two years as Severus Prince had done.

The Initiation to Wizarding Culture Professor laughed slightly, and pointed at him with a large gesture.

"Look at you, Severus!
You are not the antisocial and laconic man you were, nor a mere Professor or Potions Master.
You are a true Lord, a Prince from the Five Families.
You are not passive any more, nor completely dominated by…"

Marcus fell silent and opened his eyes wide as he suddenly realized the truth.

"You did not know, did you?" he whispered.

"I di not.
My Magical Guardian apparently forgot to tell me this little detail."

"Little?" Professor Sinistra whispered.
"But the Five Families…
It's…
It's Merlin's heritage!"

"Was the person responsible Albus Dumbledore?"

"What makes you think of him?" Severus asked collectedly.

"He has manipulated every one since forever.
He lies, betrays, and uses his fame to get what he wants.
And his goals are obvious…"

"Power," Aurora Sinistra whispered.

"Indeed, power," Severus acquiesced.

"And with what he already had, danger could only come from the Five Families," Marcus declared gloomily.
"The risk of seeing the monarchy come back must have been too pressing for him…
However, when I see how much he has fallen down now…"

"He simply made an enemy of the wrong family", Severus laughed.
"He has tried to manipulate a Kemenov."

"I looked into that family…" Selwyn said pensively.
"The Kemenovs are no less than the heirs of the Russian imperial family.
And the Russian wizarding world indirectly recognised their power."

"The Kemenov are also the most powerful clan of magical Russia.
They preside over the equivalent of our Wizengamot," Severus added.

"And rumours say that they have close links with the Courts," Marcus Selwyn sighed.

"The Courts?
Lke the Mirage Courts?" Aurora asked, astonished.

Severus held back and amused smile and leaned harder against the seat, crossing his hands in front of him.

"Indeed, the Mirage Courts.
By trying to get to Vlamdir, made an enemy of the most influential and most dangerous family in Russia, as well as of the Five Families."

"So the Five Families *are* emerging, aren't they?" the Astronomy Professor asked carefully, sliding a questioning look towards Severus.

"They are," Severus answered, amused.

"Will the King demand his throne?"

Severus was surprised to see hope in his colleague's eyes.
He did not think that wizards and witches wished to go back under the magical monarchy.
Then again, Britain was still under a monarchy.
The Muggles still had a Queen[1] as their Head of State, and now that he sometimes frequented Pure-Blood circles, he knew taht there was still hope.
One only had to note how important nobility titles were in the wzarding society.

"He won't," he cautiously answered.

The sadness the Potions Master saw in his colleague's eyes made hi think.
He thought about it for the rest of the conversation, even if it was more superficial, and he thought about it when he got back to the Chamber of Secrets.
Dinner was over, but he knew that Cedric, Vlamdir and the twines were already there.

Unsurprisingly, the four students were sitting around the Alliance HQ's desk, a substantial pile of Galleons sitting between them.
He slightly pet the reptiles that were crawling around the room and who had called the Chamber of Secrets home.
Sasha's children were calm, and he was surprised to see how appeasing snake hisses were.

Cedric, a quill in his hand, was showing several entries to the other three members.
The Hufflepuff revealed himself as gifted for accounting, and the three leaders of Hogwarts' contraband network had given him control of their small, but profitable, organization.
He had thus managed to make their money profitable by specific investments, creating the H. Alliance Company, a small trade company, strangely composed of ten associates and whise independant accounts were all in Gringott's under a secret status.
Vlamdir had used his title of Friend of the Goblin Nation, and now the Alliance had a protected vault in the Goblin kingdom and ten living members.
However, while Severus knew that the four members would be there, he did not expect to see Kevin, André, and Hermione discreetly sitting in a corner.
Curious, he approached the Muggle-Borns and Hogwarts' Magical Entity, but Kevin raised his head from the pile of parchments they were reading and shooed him away.
Two years before, Kevin would have suffered, but he now considered all those kid who were too clever for their age as his family.
He turned away, as the Sorting Hat gave him a strange wink.
The Potions Professor could not help but laugh softly while shaking his head, wondering what they could be scheming.

The last time Kevin and Hermione had hidden things from them, they had created the calling Galleons, including a Portkey, and individual alarm system, and several other wonders of enchantment.
A reall work of genius for two children only twelve years old.

"What are Hermuine and Kevin doing?" he asked, observing Cedric's coded ledgers.

"No idea," Fred sighed.

"However, I think Kevin is different today, isn't he?" George noted.

"Slightly depressed, I'd say," Vlad agreed.
"Even if he's hiding it well."

The four students looked at each other colludingly.

"But… we will…"

"… cheer him up!" Fred hummed.
"And…"

"… curiosity killed the cat!"

"Cedric, will you be able to manage…"

"… Vlad and Severus?"

"I should be able to," the Hufflepuff laughed, observing the Weasley twins' antics, while Vlad was rolling his eyes.

"Come Forge, let's see what our little geniouses have in store for us!"

"Following you, Gred," his twin smiled.

The two spitting images of each other approached Kevin and Hermione arm in arm and leaned over the pîles of parchment, smiling at the hiding attempts.

"So?"

"What are you creating…"

"… little geniuses?"

The two said geniuses looked at each other, while André started to laugh.

"They could help you out," the venerable artefact said.
"They know the castle like the back of their hand!"

Kevin gave them a perplexed look.

"For Mugles, the expression stands, but I don't want to know what on their hands!" he pointed to Fred and George, who tried to look innocent.

"Kevin is way more gifted to look like an angel," Hermioe laughed making some space on the sofa.

The two redheads sat down and looked at the documents in front of them.
Plans of the castle, enchantments similar to the Trace on their wands until they were seventeen, the Hogwarts students registry…"

"The Hogwarts students registry?" Fred nearly shouted.

"We've been wanting to read it for so long," George added, trying to grab it.
"Ouch, Mione!"

"Don't touch it, Mister Weasley," the young girl growled.
"Augusta lent it to us to the sole condition that you did not touch it!"

"What are you trying to do?" Fred asked, while his twin was hyperbolically pouting to show his discontent.
He noted that Kevin was more silent than usual, however.

"A map of Hogwarts with the location of all students…
It would be great to find a way to do a huge map of the castle," Hermione dreamed aloud.
"And Vlamdir pesters us all the time that he doesn't know where we all are."

"The little liar," Fred sniggered.
"I don't know how he manages to, but he knows exactly where we are each second.
Most of the time, he even know what we are doing!"

"Yeah, the last time, we were preparing a prank with Peeves, and when we came back… he calmly asked how the Hogwarts Poltergeist was, and if our prank would be ready to the evening," George complained.

"You are idiots," Kevin mocked them.
"It's pretty obvious and undeniably logical."

"What?"

"I won't tell you," the Muggle-Born laughed," he made me promised to tell when I understood his technique!
Can you help us for the map?"

The two readheads looked at each other, satisfied to see Kevin like his usual self.
Then, in a majestic motion, Fred took an old and damage piece of parchment from his cape, although it not have the expected effect as a stange soft sticky candy fell to the ground.

"When I said I did not to know what they had on their hands," Kevin jeered, making George and André laugh.

"What is that ?" Hermione asked, curious, turning the paper over in all directions, noticing it was blank and, especially, that it was bigger than it looked.

"This is the secret of our success," George answered, tapping on the old parchment possessively.

"We're lending it to you for an unlimited duration."

"However, it's got our name on it," his twin added with a small laugh.

"Well, we know it by heart, my dear Forge."

"Exactly, my esteemed Gred."

"What is this old parchment used for?" Kevin asked, brushing it.

"'Old parchment'?!
Sacrilege," Fred exclaimed, putting a hand on his heart.
"George!"

"Don't talk about it like that, you infidel," George grouched, taking the parchment back.

"Quicker boys," André sniggered.
"Vlad seems intrigued, and we want it to be a surprise!"

Everyone turned towards the desk, only to find two emerald green eyes staring at them.
Cedirc was still talking with Severus, but the leader of the Alliance was only distractedly listening to them.

"Does he know how to lip-read?" George suddenly worried.

Vlad's green eyes became mischevious as an amused smile appeared on his lips and he shook his head.

"Nooo!"

Fred and George suddenly turned their back to him, and a laugh could be heard from the other side of the library.

"You knew?" the first Weasley took offence.

"Of course," Hermione sniggered.

"Merlin, our dear and innocent Hermione is becoming insidious!
Kevin, stop leading her astray!"

"Not my fault," Kevin laugjed, giving them a most innocent look.

"Huh, butter wouldn't melt in his mouth," Fred grumbled.
"And to say that in the beginning, I didn't understand what you were doing with a wizard of Vlad's calibre…"

"Yeah, you're even worse," George added, "because we're not expecting it from you."

"You haven't seen the Dark Magic Hermione emits when she is angry," Andre added.
"When she understands the subtleties of Magic, you'll have a band of friendly Dark Mages."

"Er…
Dark Mages?" Fred worried.

The Weasley twins looked at each other worringly, which every one picked up on.
For most British wizards, Dark Magic was synonymous with evil, death, and pain.
Which was wide of the mark in reality.

"Blimey, a whole education to redo," the Sorting Hat grumbled.
"Dark Magic, Light Magic…
There's not much of a difference when you factor the power and the intention of the wizard or witch.
You can make people suffer with a so-called Light spell."

"Light Magic uses only the wizard's internal magic, or for Mages, the ambiant magic, but softly.
Dark Magic necessitates a payment," Kevin decalred.
"Life, blood, soul…
It's quite closer to Ancient Magic when it calls on external sacrifices."

"External sacrifices?" Fred noted.
"How do you do a sacrifice of yourself?"

Kevin reached out with his hand and jabbed at his finger with the tip of his pen.

**"Burn."**

The blood immediately caught fire, giving off an impressive amount of heat.

"You can also use skin, hair, nails… or even a finger for bigger and more dangerous spells."

"Charming," George mumbled.

"And to get back to the explanation of the 'Mage' term, in its truest sense, it's a wizard or witch who can use ambient magic that is present all around us," André sighed.

"And to get back to this?" Hermione asked, tapping on the parchment avidly.

"We found it in Filch's office…"

"By the way…
Why hasn't the Headmistress fired his?" Fred sighed.

"… It was put inside a drawer labled 'Confiscated Dangerous Objects'…"

" You know how we're curious as soon as something's labeled dangerous," Fred continued.

"And we managed to snatch that right under his nose…" George concluded.

"And what is it?"

"A wonder of enchantments."

None of the three curious beings asked about the decrepit aspect.
It was obvious that a powerful artefact to help with pranks had to be unnoticeable.

"I solemny sweat that I am up to no good," George carefully said, pointing his wand on the parchment.

Under their attentive eyes, small ink lines started to appear from the parchment, and they slowly started to form corridors, stairs, eventually revealing a detailed map of the castle and the park, as well as what they recognised as an identification of the living beings in the Castle.

> Messers Moony, Wormtail, Padfoot and Prongs
> Purveyors of Aid to Magical Mischief-Makers
> are proud to present
> THE MARAUDER'S MAP

"It's simply… wonderful," Hermione whispered, as tiny dots were moving here and there, accompanied by names sketched in.

Under their eyes, the Headmistress's office was occupied by Augusta, as well as Filch and Mrs. Norris, which made the twins satisfied.
Maybe he would finally disappear from the school!

"Genoious," Kevin gushed.
"How does it work?"

"You are the enchanting geniuses," Fred sighed.
"We are more gifted in Potions.
But those four, Moony, Wormtail, Padfoot and Prongs… they were good.
We owe them so much!"

"They were good men, full of grandeur, who wored to help future geenrations break the rules," George smiled.

"However, we're lending it to you, but don't forget to wipe it after each use, otherwise…"

"Every one could read it," Fred warned.

"You only need to say 'Mischief managed'."

Hermione, André and Kevin were already studying the map, mumbling between themselves, which made the twins smile.
They were about to warn them that the other three members were approaching, when…

"Huh, I don't remember a Gryffindor named Pettigrew," Hermione said suddenly, before shivering at the magical wave that rippled through the Alliance HQ.

"Pettigrew?" Severus said with a hateful spark in his eyes.

"As in Peter Pettigrew?" Vlamdir spat out, responsible of the magical wave.

"Yes," Hermione whispered.

"Where is he?"

"I…"

"Vlad, all Marauders were Animagi," Severus added.

"Password?" the Russian said between his teeth, raging.
Hermione did not event try to ask for an explanation.
Not when her friend was so furious, she valued her life.

"Vile scoundrel"

"Kev?"

"Behind you," the Ravenclaw said while standing up, tapping on his robes to check that both wands were there.

"Severus, can you go see Augusta?"

"Right away.
But before…"

Severus leaned over the table were the Muggle-Borns parchments lied and scartched a noted, handing it to Vlad.

"As soon as you enter the Common Room, Minerva will know.
If I'm not here with Augusta in time, give her this note."

"Cedric, stay here.
Fed, George, you as well.
I don't want you to have problems with members of your House.
Hermione…
Whatever this is, I want you to analyse and discover all the associated spells.
Filius will help you when we will tell him."

Vladmir pointed to the Marauder's Map, which still showed the names pf the people in the castle.
He had understood roughly how the map worked, and wanted to know if one could adapt it to another scale, like a city, or a country…

"And don't forget for tonight!"

All nodded and Vlamdir left the Alliance HQ in a whirlwind, followed by his best friend."

**"Vlad.
Who is Pettigrew?"** Kevin eventually asked, as they quickly climbed up hte giant stairs to get to the Gryffindor Common Room.

Vlad slightly turned his head to look at him, then smiled slightly.
Kevin rarely spoke Russian, except when he did not want to be understood by other students.
He greeted a few students that were in their way with a nod.

**"The true traitor.
The one who manipulated everyone from my family, to the magical world."**

Kevin nodded.
He had understood for a while that Sirius Black was no the traitor, so some one else was.
He could finally put a name on him.

**"And what is there tonight?"**

Vlamdir smiled, but did not answer.
They continued climbing towards the Gryffindor tower, and to their surprise, Luna was waiting for them in front of the entry, babbling with Ginerva Weasley and a horrible portrait that represended a knight on his grey fat pony.

"Hey!
You Scoundrels!
Who dares adventures into the bold Gryffindor's land without wearing his colours?
En garde!"

"Ah, Vlad," Luna smiled, ingoring Sir Cadogan's anger.

"Sure?" Vladmir groaned, ignoring the fear that one could read inside the young Ginny's eyes, as well as the repeated attempts from the portrait to catch his attention.

At the same time, the door opened on Ginerva's brother, who was grumbling between his teeth.
Kevin smiled, amused despite the situation, when he realised that his dark robes were covered in ginger hairs.

"Ah, Ginny, did you see Mione?"

"No, why?"

"Her bloody cat ate Scabbers!
He's gone!"

"Your rat?"

"Yeah, my rat, anything wrong with that Vladmir?" Ronald growled.

At the same time, an orange whirlwind ran between Ron's and Vlamdir's legs, jumping directly into Kevin's arms.
The Ravenclaw skilfully caught the half-Kneazle and pet his ears, while looking into his eyes.

"Did you eat the rat?" he calmly asked Crookshanks.

As a response, the cat yowled and spit slightly, while Kevin continued asking Hermione's Kneazle nonsensical questions.
Meanwhile, Ron was still yelling about the cat and Kevin at the same time, which irritated Vladmir, until…

"You mate is mad, you know that, Vlad?"

"A pauper suffering from foley?
By the Ancients…"

**"Kevin, your tatoo,"** Vlamdir groaned, exasperated by the screams from both the knight and Ron.

Kevin, still holding Crookshanks, distractedly rolled up his sleeve.
Sir Cadogan, proudly sitting on his, horrendously blasphemed while falling backwards.
This made Ron and Ginny smile, while Luna simply smiled.

"Good Lord!
Beg for the Knight's forgiveness!" the portrait yelled, pointing his spear at Ron, threatening.
Because this knoigh, according to popular wisdom, was one of the members of Arthur's court, and as such, knew what this tatoo meant.

"Who, me?" Ron was astounded at Sir Cadogan's sudden about-turn.

"Hear I right, young insolent, you do not apologize to the Lord?
By the Ancients, this is dire!"

"What Lord, by Merlin!?" Ron cursed.

"The Knight-Mage, linked to the Potter Line!"

"Stand down, Knight,"Kevin smiled as Ron was still dumbstruck, eveidently not understanding the reference.
"Traditions peter out.
You will be so kind as to open the door to us?"

"I may, with the password Knight."

"Vile Scoundrel."

**"Dark Magic, Vlade?"** Kevin asked distractedly, as the portrait pivoted.

**"No, if he's in his Animags form, he wouldn't be found, even with Dark Magic."**

**"And something simple like 'Point me Peter Pettigrew'?"**

**"Only if he's in a one kilemetre radius and in human form."**

Kevin gramaced while holding Crookshanks against him, and entered the Common Room, steeping in front of Professors Prince, McGonagall, and Logbottom.
All the students had gone into the dormitories, leaving the room empty.

"You took your time," Augusta wondered.

"I am sorry, Headmistress, we had a slight setback on the way."

**"Slight?
If he continues to pig out during the meals, he won't be a slight setback soon,"** Kevin whispered to Crookshanks, who purred in response, making Vladmir smile.

"He's not here any more," Vlamdir sighed.

Augusta Longbottom did not try to find who 'he' was referring to.
Severus  had quickly tolld here about the presence of the former Gryffindor and traitor in the Gryffindor dormitories.
She trusted the Potions Master, and third Triad.
She thus did not question his words when he asked her to trust his sources.
However, the Head of Gryffindor seemed more surprised.

"How can you be so sure?"

Vlamdir let his gaze impreceptibly slip towards Luna's pale hair, which made the Headmistress thoughtful.

"Mister Weasley.
I believe you are the only one with a pet other than a cat or an owl…"

"Neville has a toad."

"I know my grandson's familiar, young man."

"Ye… yes, of… of course," Ron stuttered, intimidated by Augusta's severe face and his Head of House's pinched lips.
"I have… had a rat, but this bloodly cat ate it!"

"Language, Mister Weasley!" the severe Head of Gryffindor took offence.

"Severus, would a rat correspond him?"

"A rat, a spider…"

"A spider?" Ron paled.

"Ron, your rat, does it miss a finger on its front left paw?"

"Yes, but how…"

Vlamdir ignored him and turned to Augusta.

"The only thing they found of hiw was a finger."

"How long has it been in your family?" Kevin asked in turn, unnerving Ron.

"He was Percy's before…
I'd say nearly thirteen years…"

"It's long for a rat, even a magical one," Kevin noted, petting Crookshanks.

"We take good care of him, and he was nearing the end!
He was shaking, did not eat any more…"

"Since this summer?" Severus asked dryly, cutting his sentence, making the young lion grow even paler.
Behind him, Luna and Ginny stayed silent.

"Yes, but…"

Once more, Ron was ignored, and Severus turned towards the Hogwarts Headmistress.

"When Black escaped.

"So we have a second fugitive in the wild," Augusta mumbled.
"Mister and Miss Weasley, please go back to your dormitories.

The two redheads looked at each other and wanted to protest, but they immediately obeyed when they looked at the Headmistress.
Although Augusta was a maternal and protective with her friends and familiy, she had quickly acquired a reputation based on intransigeance and total equality in the school.
No one tried to contest the new subjects, do shameless favouritisme, or discriminate between Houses.

They disappeared under the dark glances from the five remaining wizards and witches.

"Miss Lovegood, any useful detail to share?" Professor Prince eventually asked.

"The belmagiles talk about traitors," Luna babbled, playing with Crookshanks's paws.
"The owl in the shadow, the rodent in darkness."

Neither Vlad nor Kevin were perturbed by the sybilline words from the young Ravenclaw, while Minerva McGonagall frowned.
Her lips were only a fine line, and she seemed furious.
Severus gave her a severe look to shut her uo;

"The owl?" Augusta eventually asked softly.

Luna gave him and enigmatic smile, before going back to yank on Crookshanks's mustaches, who purred enthusiastically.

"Dumbledore," Kevin translated.

"Here is not the ideal place to talk about him…" the Headmistress declared softly.
"Follow me.
Minerva, please free your students.
There is no risk."

"Augusta, with all due respect, I want to know why you alterted me in a hurry!" Minerva McGonagall suddenly exploding, emitting a sound nearing a yowl.
"Why have you sent the students in the dormitories!"

"It may be that our fugitive is an Animagus, and that he has visited the Gryffindor dormitories," Severus brilliantly eluded, without saying which fugitive.
Immediately, the Transfiguration Professor thus thought about Sirius Black.

"An… an Animagus?
But…"

"All Marauders were able to transform," Augusta sighed.

"But…"

Vladmir looked at her with contempt.
He still did not like the old owl who taught Transfiguration, even when she had started to make some effort since the start of the year.
He could not forget about the first two years, when she had repeatedly knocked him down as he deperately tried to stay afloat.

"Now, Minerva, please take care of your students.
Gentlement, Miss Lovegood, please come with me."

And thus they all got to the Headmistress's office, around a tea cup, waiting for Sergei to appear.
Katya could not come, because of some obscure thing about babysitting that necessitated her presence.

"What have you done this time Kitten?" the vampired asked amusingly, stepping out of the chimney.

"Pettigrew is alive."

"I know, Black and Lucius had a litlle discussion yesterday," the vampire sighed.
"The Malfoy Manor House Elves had to call Katya urgently before the whole home exploded due to the offensive spells they used.

"Who's the idiot who gave Black a wand?" Kevin asked, getting amused lookes.
"What?
Frankly this man is completely perturbed by prison, and he reacts like Vlad or me.
He's so childish!"

"No, you have more restraint and mastery of yourself than him," Sergei laughed.
"He is incapable of not reacting to provocation."

"He's a bloody stupid mutt…"

"Definitely neutral, Sev," Agusta said, amused, sipping her cup of tea.

"Definitely," the Potions Master sniggered.
"Although I believe that he managed to put his hand on one of the Malfy Manor training wands.
It's painful to say, but he is extremely powerful to cast dangerous offensive spells even with a children's wand."

"Does he know that Pettigrew is alive?"

"Yes.
According to Sirius, Pettigrew was the one to blow up the street to escape."

"A sacrifice, a life…" Luna said dreamily.

"She's not wrong, it's one of the principles of Dark Magic.
Sacrifices are necessary to reach specific goals.
And Pettigrew never had the magical power to cast such a powerful spell alone."

"The priority is stil lAlbus Dumbledore," Sergei declared.
"Finding Pettigrew is just a detail."

Vlamdir groaned, not agreeing, but he did not say anything more.
He knew that eventually, all the responsible people would end up six feet under, but for now, the rat could run.

"Don't worry, Keller is tracking Albus," Augusta had a predatory smile.
"And there is a bounty on his head.
Should he dare surface again, all the bounty hunters will be on his tracks…"

"Keller?"

"The best tracker in the _Underground_," Severus answered Kevin's curious question.
He could also see the same interrogation in Vlamdir's eyes.
"He is charged with rummaging through the Dumbledore family's homes, as well as all the places he could have taken refuge in."

"The Flamels?" Augusta asked softly.
"He had very strong links with Nicolas and they managed to keep their residence private for centuries."

"Not ever since Dumbledore mysteriously lost the Philosopher's Stone," Sergei sniggered, looking at Vladmir.

"I did not have a hand in this," the latter laughed softly.
"You should ask Draco."

"What has my son done this time?"

All jumped when they realized that Lucius Malfoy had just appeared in the chimney, a magnificent blackk eye decorating his usually spotless face.

"Black?" Severus tried, incredulous.
He had never seen any injury on his best friend's perfect face, although he suspected he sometime had used a camouflage spell to hide the wounds.

"No, I think it's my dear aunty's work," Vlamdir sniggered.
"She has a particular way of punching, and she's left-handed."

Lucius grimaced and brushed his cheekbone.

"She has quite the left hook," he admitted.
"The only thing that is a relief is that Sirius had the same treatment."

"And yet, she was soft," Sergei added, amused.
"In general, she prefers to break noses or teeth."

"To get back to Draco, he simply stole the Philosopher's Stone right under Dumbledore's nose," Vlamdir laughed.

A spark of greed lit up in the Malfoy patriarch's grey eyes.

"And where is my wonderful son?" he purred.

"In an unprecedented kind gesture, he gave it back to its rightful owners," Kevin answered dramitically, making everyone laugh.

"My son is disowned," Lucius groaned, siting down in a seat the he had just made appear, the laughs redoubling.

"What if you ask the Goblins for help?" Kevin suddenly interved.

"What do you mean?" Augusta asked, slightly lost at the sudden change of topics.

"Well, nearly all the wizards and witches have an account in the wizarding bank, and all the assets are listed there.
The Dumbledore are probably not the exception, and all the homes are listed there…"

"… including the ones under the Fidelius charm," Vlad realized.
"You are a true…"

"Genius?" I know," Kevin answered modestly.

"I would have said Gryffindor!"

"Traitor!"

"Although Kevin are wrong on one point," Lucius declared.
"Goblins never give out this kind of information.
They are too proud of their secrecy clause, which even the Minister cannot overstep, and Merlin knows how many times Fudge tried!"

Lucius knew it because he was Fudge's personal advisor, and he had had to put up with his complaining for hours…

"Except Vlamdir is a Friend of the Goblin Nation.
He is an honorary Goblin, and even a member of the Russian Mirage Court.
No Goblin would refuse to help him."

Lucius stayed silent to take the news in, as did Severus.
Neither of them knew Vladmir's special status, and that was incredible.

"You know you are…" Severus started.

"The first wizard since…"

"Two centuries?" Kevin completed.
"Yes, he knows."

The two Ravenclaw exchanged an amused gaze, as Augusta sighed.

"You know Minerva is tearing her hair out with you?" the Headmistress sighed.
"The Gemini, if I remember correctly."

"That's sad, her bun is always perfect," Vlad said, saddened.
"It would be nice to see her a little less… uptight."

"Plus, we don't like her," Kevin retorted.
"I don't see why we should be perfect in class with that old…"

"Kevin!"

"Old owl?
Old hag?" Vlamdir tried, as the venerable Longbottom matriarch seemed to have swallowed a lemon.

"Vlamdir!" the Headmistress took offence, looked at the two boys with wide eyes.

The students looked at each other knowingly, while the four adults laughed softly.
It was rare to see them share that childishnes.
But it was refreshing, in a way.
They were still children.

"By the way, Lucius, did you have a problem?" Severus wondered.

"Apart from a shrew in the Manor?" the Lord sighed.

"If you and Sirius could argue less, she would be more accommodatiing," Sergei said with a smile.
"Do you know where I can find Keller?"

"In the _Tube_."

Sergei nodded.
The _Tube_ was the Underground HQ, right in the middle of the famous London Piccadily Circus Underground station.
It could be accessed through a dark and shabby bar from the magical London, and through the station from the Muggle side.
The underground netword was a veritable playground for the _Underground_'s magical creatures, and it was their kingdom.
Contrary to Russia, or even Ireland and France, vmapires, werewolves, metamorphoses and rarer creatures were unwelcome, and most gathered in the London Underground.

"I'll go see Jack's pack.
If I remember correctly, they are around Baker Street station…
They owe me a favour, and their sense of smell is great.
If Pettigrew is in London, they would smell him, whatever his form," Sergei smiled.

"Be careful, I think Valerius is not keen on welcoming you."

Sergei made a menacing grin, showing his canines.
The last time he had seen the London Clan Chief, they had fought for dominance.
And unsurprisingly, the Russian had won.
He was a little long in the tooth, and vampires become more powerful as they age.

"Jack, as in Jack Ripper, the Alpha of the London pack?" Vlad asked calmly.
When Severus had taken over for Professor Lupin's class during the first month, he had done a deep class on werewolves.
And he had cited famous names.

"Indeed," Sergei confirmed.

"Was he really Jack the Ripper?" Kevin raved.
"I read in an old article that it was because of him that werewolves lost many of their rights in Britain!"

"Not quite.
Jack is the grandson of Jack the Ripper.
Jack had quite the problem with a… certain feminine occupation," he clarified, getting a few sniggers, "and like all wolves, he attacked by lacerating.
A wolf attack was never a pretty sight…

Jack is as violent, but between Fenrir Greyback, the other dominating Alpha of England, and him, you're better off dealing with Jack," Sergei warned.
"Fenrir likes human flesh, especially children's"

"Charming…" Kevin snorted.

"Well, not that I'm bored," Vlamdir suddenly declared," but we've got some research to do.

"What research?" Kevin asked, lost.

"For what the twins lent us, and for the group project."

"Shit, I forgot!" Kevin swore, getting a hit on the head from Lucius.

"Language," the Lord explained.

Kevin poute adorablu, making the adults grumble.
How could a child both be this diabolical and seem so innocent?

"Was it what you were talking avout earlier?" Kevin understood as Vlamdir stood up.

"Yes!
Well, see you later!" Vlamdir cut him up, dragging his friend out of the office, as Luna was skipping merrily behind them, humming.

"But… that's not the way to the Library!" Kevin suddenly realized, as he let himself be dragged towards the Ravenclaw Common Room, with Neville and Luna.

"We're late," Luna laughed.

"Late for what?" Kevin rage up as Vladmir opened the way to the Common Room.

"For this," Neville laughed, pushing him inside with Hermione and Draco.

Kevin froze when he saw all his friends gathered around a huge cake, smiling at him.

**"Happy birthday, brother,"** Vlamdir whispered.

Kevin closed his eyes and swallowed.
It had been two years since any one had celebrated his birthday…
He had found his true family.
