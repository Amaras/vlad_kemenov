## Chapter 31: Things start to accelerate 

_"Crucio!"_

**"Protect"**

**"By all the clans, who are you?"** Vladmir yelled
**"Burn!"**

Burning and nearly uncontrolled flames spewed out of the young Russain heir's wand, as the reare passers-by in Loki street took care to get as far away from that as possible.
The attack was crutal, in daylight, in a dark spot of the alley, where people did not meddle in this kind of stuff.

Vladmir's blaze melted the dirty snow that covered the cobbleston on the gloomy alleyway in the Dark quarters of Saint-Petersburd's magical zone.
The young boy made a large circular motion with his wand to form a flaming vortex that he pointed to the attacker, focussing to keep it under control.

The instant it would touch the man, he cast a curse that could be lethal.
Vlamdir rolled in the dirt to avoid this attack.
The other one was fast, very fast, he tought as the mucky windows of a stored exploded at the impact of a second spell.
Vladur swore hen he realised that he could not controll his flames any more and lost a few precious secods to cancel the flames that threatened the shops.

It was enough for his enemy to hit him with a particularly vicious curse.

Vladmir cast a simple but efficient _Protego_, as he started to cough out blood, breathing heavily, and  a powerful spell hit the shield, cracking it slightly.

**"Fuck!"** he swore, painfully caughing.
He felt his blood slowly filling his lungs.
Whatever this spell was, it started a pulmonary haemorrhage.
He would drown he if could not heal quickly...
Quite charming, really!

Vlad strengthened his shield the instant it would have exploded at the next attack.
Where was his guard?

Friedrich the appeared behind the attacked and swiftly slit his throat, blood gushing on the ground.
The Kemenov guard looked around while letting the lifeless body fall and rushed to Vladmir's side, who had slumped against a wall, breathing with great diffuculty.

**"What happened, Vladmir Vassilievitch?"** Friedrich worried as Vladmir coughed out blood again.

**"Haemorrhage,"** Vladmir managed to whisper as blood streamed from his mouth.

Friedrich swore, pressing the clan Kemenov symbol on his wizarding robes, before quickly pushing away Vladmir's cape.

**"They attacked me in the alleyway and broke my wand,**" the guard whispered, slowly feeling Vladmir's torso.
**"If Sergei does not arrive quickly enought, I'll have to do it manually."**

Vladmir vaguely laughed, stopping immediately when he coughed blood again.

Friedrich sighed.
Apparating with a gravely injured person was hard.
He wanted to wait, but a late intervention could kill Vladmir...
Friedrich opened his eyes wide when Vladmir gave him his wand.
A wand was very personal, and would never allow itself to be used by another wizard, in normal circumstances...

**"Do... what... you.. have... to..."** Vlamdir managed to say.

Friedrich pointed VLamdir's wand to him, and started to whisper complex healing spells.
It was part of the skills of all the Kemenov guards.
Attack, Defence, healing...
To his surprise, the wand let itself be used easily, probably because it felt its wiazrd was in danger.

He slowly drained the blood from the young heir's lung and was starting to search for the cause of the haemmorrhage, when he heard the noise of an Apparition.
Friedrich immediately turned to protected Vladmir's body, threatening the possible assailants.

**"Peace Friedrich.
Tashka guard us."**

Friedrich lowered his weapon and turned his attention back towards Vladmir, as Sergei and the three other Kemenov guards approached.

**"THe Heirsess in the sky watches over us,"** he whispered as Sergei gave out orders.

They were identification codes of the Kemenov clan in case of an attack, to be sure of the identity of their reinforcements.

**"What happened?"** Sergei asked as Vladmir stayed immobile.
**"Not you! Friedrich?"**

Vladmir grimaced when the vampire prevented him from talking, and focused on Friedrich's wand movements, as his face slowly swelled.

**"I was following Vladmir from a few metres back, as usual, when he passed the intersection with the alleyway.
I was about to turn, when two men attacked be; they probably had troll blood, judging by their strengh and poor magical abilities.
The first thing they did was breaking my wand.
Meanwhile, Vlad was attacked."**

**"That explains the broken neck, the stab in the heart, and the throat cutting,"** Borislav declared, walking closer.
The guards had retrieved the corpses, and Friedrich, once the healing was done, could finally see the damages caused by their battle.
Apart from the blood that mingled with the mud of the alley, an antique store had a large hole in its window, while another one was half-burnt.
No trace of their owners, however.
In this quarter, all fled when they saw a major battle.

**"Vladmir Vassilievitch, are you all right?"**

**"Alright,"** the pale boy whispered as he sat up, leaning on Sergei.

**"Did you lose much blood?"**

"**He did not, I reinjected what was in his lungs,"** Friedrich declared.
**"You need to see the medic or Nikolai, though.
It was Dark magic, and we need to ensure it was not a curse that would come back when you least expect it."**

**"Who was it?"** Vlad finally asked as the cadavers were already gone, carried away by two of the guards.

Borislav gramaced and showed them a blood-tainted cape.
A coat-of-arms was carefully embroidered in gold thread.

**"It was the youngest of clan Fedovir, Ermolai Ivanovitch Fedovir.
From the small number of them, I think he attacked independantly from his father's will."**

**"It is starting to become tedious," Vladmir whispered, taking back his wand to clean his robes stained with blood and mood.

**"Tedious?"** Sergei repeated with a smile that did not reach his eyes crimson with fury.
**"It was the second attack on your person, Vlad.
One can be forgiven, a second one needs a response, and a third one..."**

**"We will start a Clan War,"** the young Kemenov heir agreed.

They could not leave these attacks unpunished without looking weakened, and their clan could allow it.
Not without becoming a target for the other great Russian Houses.

**"Anton has left Fedovir's corpse on their palace's stairs, it will be their last warning.
You go back home and see Nokolai to get healed correctly.
The medic is busy elsewhere.
Katya has a mission that ends tomorrow, I will let her know when she comes back."**

The young boy nodded, and Friedrich had an order to accompany him to get healed as well.
Half of his face had turned a mix of red and purple, and his limp was noticeable.
He probably had been injured in other ways as well.

Vladmir observed the blood-stained place that was goiing to be fully cleaned by Sergei and his men, then took the arm of his friend and guard.
He whined at the sucction feeling and landed in the back alley of the Kemenov palace.
The man on guard duty immediately reacted.

**"Blimey, Vladmir Vassilievitch!
Friedrich!
Call Nikolai!"**

The young heir whispered for a long time on the way to see the vampire, making the two men smile.
He was widely known that Vladmir hated to be in the infarmary or the hospital.
He had been in there too many times, despite his age.
His only relief was that he had never needed a patient the Hogwarts Hospital Wing, althoug he knew that there were bets among the guards to see when he would need to go there.

**"By all the saints, what happened to you?"** the vampire grumbled, forcing his two patients to lie down, who wanted to stay sat down.
**"If you do not stay put, I will knock you unconscious!"**

Immediately, both calmed down, and Nikolai smirked.

**"There we go, you a good argument, you are as gentle as a lamb!
While I do a complete exam, tell me what Vladmir did this time."**

"Oi! why me?"** the young boy protested, trying to sit up.

Nikolai growled, showing his fangs, and Vlad let himself fall back on the bed, mumbling.

The vampire's magic covered them both, and he sighed as he listened to Friedrich's report.

**"They are stupid trying to defy us, they are totally outnumbered."**

**"Except if they are manipulated,"** Vlad grumbled.

**"What do you mean?"**

**"You said it yourself, except if they are stupid.
Ivan Fedovir is not stupid.
Reckless, yes, as the duel proved, but not stupid."**

Vladmir seemed to have an epiphany and suddenly sat up.

**"You are not real!"** Nikolai raged.
**"Lie down and stay Vladmir Vassilievitch, or I swear I will knock you out!"**

**"I need to talk to Sergei!"**

**"I will, as soon as I have finished your examination.
For now, don't move!"**

Vladmir obeyed, grouching, and stayed immobiled for the medical exam.
When the medical spells finished their analysis of the two patients, Nikolai pointed his wand on two parchments and carefully read the information that was writting itself.

**"Good..."**

He stood up, and slipped inside the store, and came back with a dozen fials.

**"Friedrich, you have nothing apart from a cracked rib, a muscle ripped in your thigh following a blunt force trauma, and some bruises.**"

He gave him three brightly coloured vials.

**"The purple potion with strenghen your bones, the transparent one will quicken the healing process, and the third one will reduce pain.
You will probably be tired, because your body will be strained by the first two potions.
Go back to your quarters and sleep, understood?"**

**"Yes Nikolai."**

**"Go, then,"** the former Tsar of Russia dismissed him.

Friedrich obeyed without saying anything, as Nikolai turned to his young patient, worry in his eyes.

**"It's bad,"** Vladmir immediately understood, calmly drinking the potions the vampire gave him.

"**Yes, and no."**

Vlad raised an eyebrow, and Nikolai sighed.

**"What this Ermolai Fedovir cast was a two-effect curse."**

**"Short and long term effect,"** the heir completed.
**"And you don't know when the second part will happen, nor what will trigger it."**

**"Exactly.
Did you hear his incantation?"**

**"Not fully, it was latin and I was busy controlling the fire I accidentally caused."**

**"Can you give me what you heard?"**

Vladmir obeyed and wrote down some words on a parchment.
Nikolai would research and give Gigori those words.
Who better than an immortal Dark mage to find a curse?"

**"Can I go now?"** Vladmir hopefully asked.

**"You can.
Be very careful, stay near someone who knows elementary healing spells.
Also avoid Dark magic, it is probably be a trigger.
Go to sleep, I will tell Sergei about your idea on the Fedovir."**

Vladmir did not wait any more, and ran to his appartments.
He opened the door, and the young boy only had time to hear a happy quaver before his world went dark.

"Vladmir.
Vladmir," a known voice suddenly yelled.

Vladmir fell a weight on his shoulder and sighed.
He knew troubles were coming.

"It's a tragedy!
A catastrophe!"

"Calm down," Vlad tempered.

"Petrified... missed..."

"André, calm down!" the Russian yelled, getting the Sorting Hat off his head to look at it at eye height.
The first thing that shocked him was the venerable hat's aspect.

"I... did not know that you could change colours," Vlad noted as André had taken a greenish tint, which quickly became red.

"Alright, I was a human once," André whispered.

"Anyway, what happened?" Vlad asked, promissing himself to ask him about his past when he had time.
Was André not supposed to be _created_ by the founders?
Fawkes was still restless on his shoulder, flapping his wings in worry.

"Kevin and Hermione were attacked!
She is alright, but Kevin is petrified.
She need to talk to you now!"

Vladmir swore and ran in the corridor, André still in his hands, and Fawkes somehow holding on his shoulder, prestesting againstwhat his perch was doing.

He left the family wing of the palace, ignoring portraits that were offended to see him running in their gallery and raced down the honour stairs.
He ignored the comments of the clan members he met, and opened Sergei's office door.
The room was bright despite the weather, and him and Nikolai were in a great conversation.
Both vampired turned to Vladmir

**"Sergei, I need to go to Hogwarts now."**

**"Vlad, you should not go in your stated, you could..."**

**"Nikolai, thank you, but my friends were attacked, Hermione is okay, but Kevin..."**

**"Then go,"** Sergei sighed, **"but jsut before, take this..."**

Sergei stood up and rumbled through a shelf that was protected by vampiric magic.
He took a medallion carefully forged with the Kemenov coat-of-arms chiselled in white gold.

**"I was meaning to give it to you because you get attacked too much.
It is an international Portkey that will bring you in the palace entry hall.
The activation word is Natashka.**"

**"Thank you..."**

**"Katya wil be back tonight.
I will immediately tell her about both your attackand Kevin's.
Even though I am sorry for him, it is proof you are innocent, and your aunt will probably use it to bury the Headmaster even more.
Don't take unnecessary risks, Vladmir."**

**"Not Dark magic, I got it,"** he responded.

**"Exactly."**

Fawkes, impatient, did not wait any longer and teleported his friends in the Alliance room.
It was completely empty.

"It is six, everyone is at dinner time."

"Very well, tell me what happened since the start of the year.
It has been nearly two weeks..."

"Didn't you have news?
I thought Neville was supposed to keep you posted?"

"I was in a Mirage Court mission on Sakhalin."

Vladmir did not say more, and André did not ask for more.
Sakhalin was a Russian island a hundred kilometres from Japan, and that was the source of an international struggle between the Ministries for Magic fo the Chinese, Japanese, and Russian governments.
He was not surprising that this same disagreement happened in the Mirage Courts as well.

"To keep it simple, not much...
Severus should be done with the _Veritaserum_ tonight, and the twins will use in on Ginny as soon as possible.
Kevin was still deemed responsible, but it was more subtle.
All the Pure-Blood passed the word around that he was untouchable.
Fred and George had an idea to create a solid form of Veritaserum, since they have a perfect base to work on.
Severus is thrilled at this idea, and they spend all their free time in the lab.
Real mad men...
Fortunately, Luna sometimes goes in to bring some slight chaos in there.

Vladmir smiled as he imagined the scene.
Luna entering without permission and rummaging through the potions with her dreamy looks, Severus Prince and the twins screaming at her, as she made sure to pause their research so they took some time to speak with the others...

"Where is Kevin?"

"IN the Hospital Wing, in a room reserved for the petrified people."

"What are the alarm spells."

"None."

"None?" Vlad repeated, incredulous.

"No alarm spell was put on them.
Pompom wanted to put powerful spells, but Dumbledore refused."

"If someone wanted to take advantage of them while they were in that stated?
This bloody Headmaster is crazy.
And who is Pompom?"

"Pomona Pomfrey, the Matron.
That's her nickname.
There is no alarm spell, but she is quite wily.
She asked Severus to give her Muggle technology.
There is a motion detector in the room's entrance.

"Muggle technology doesn't work in Hogwarts," Vlad retorted, surprised.

"Nothing electronic.
Severus used something simple, but efficient.
Dozens of threads linked to a bell.
The threads are charmed to be invisible, and the bell is very loud, but just for the Matron.
Wherever she is in the castle, she will know if someone enters through the door."

"She is clever," Vlad said with a smile.
"Fawkes, can you bring me directly in the room, good boy?"

The phoenix cooed and Vladmir appeared between the statues, laid down on beds.
Next to the window, Kevin was frozen in a defenseive posture, an arm reaching back, his wand in the other.
His eyes were threatening despite his state, and his lips were slightly parted.

The young Russian could almost see what happened...
Kevin, noticing the Parsletongue, had tried to protect Hermione from the Basilisk, a spell on his lips.
Although he should have been dead if he had looked into its eyes.

"The Bloody Baron protected him," André said, guessing his train of thoughts.

"The Slytherin ghost?"

"Indeed.
When Kevin protected Hermione, the Baron appeared declaring that he could not let a noble Parsletongue and a young licorine suffer from one man's folly.
He was the one that took most of the Basilisk's power, according to Hermione.

"Lockhart's wand," Vlamdir whispered, slightly worried.
"He should have it on him!
Maybe that's the one he was using."

"It was, but Hermione really was calm.
She immediately reacted and took Kevin's second wand to the HQ.
Nobody knows that Kevin has two wands, including one without the Trace."

"Thank Merlin," Vlad sighed in relief, distractedly petting the phoenix.
"How far along is the antidote?"

"The mandrakes are not mature enough yet."

Vladmir nodded and asked Fawkes to bring them back to the HQ, after a last glance at Kevin.

"The potion in ready, Mr. Kemenov."

Vladmir smiled at the Professor, who had just burst out of the adjacent laboratory, and who was looking him with wariness.

"Vladmir, sir.
You can call me Vladmir."

"You are covered in blood, and you reek of Dark Magic, Vladmir, as if... you were cursed."

"I was," the young Russian softly answered.
"Please avoid the subject with my friends, Professor."

"Seveurs."

Vladmir smiled softly when his Potions Professor went back to the laboratory with a swirl of his cape.

"The dinner is nearly over Vlad."

"I know, I need to talk to Severus..."

Vladmir entered the laboratory and noted the changed since the cration of the room.
He recognised Severus's vision in the organisation.
All was perfectly at its place, lit up without direct light, but with a slight craziness from the twins that was obvious.
The potions that boiled and spat out small multicoloured hearts in a corner, a workbench covered in pastel candies...

Severus Prince was standing in front of the Veritaserum cauldron, bottling the potion.

"Do you have questions, Vladmir?"

"You could say that."

The Russian sat down on the table, and started to pass empty vials to the Professor, who filled them and labelled them one after the other.

"How are the negociation with the _Underground_ going?"

"It is advancing, slowly but surely.
We resumed contact with about fifty former members who renewed thir otth.
Augusta took care of the ten or so who refused."

Needless to say, ten mysterious bodes had been found in the Thames or at their homes...
Vlamdir did not necessarily like this kind of purges that regularly happened in the Mirage Courts, but his was an integral part of their existence.
Traitors and deserters were killed off.
After some time, memory charms were not ususable any more, especially since they could be reverted with great effort.

"Is there a name for the third Triad?"

"Not yet.
Augusta is still in the interim."

"Problems with your new status?"

"Apart from the fact that half the Slytherins became sycophantic with me?
Not really.
Many invitatino to balls and society happenings, and two dozens marriage proposals," Severus sneered.
"It's pretty much the first time a woman is interested in me."

"You had your charm in the Saturnalia ball."

"Mock me, young man.
According to Katya, you have at least a proposal per month in Russia."

"And they are declined each time.
Aving royal blood leads to this kind of inconvenience.
And... Dumbledore?" Vlad asked carefully.

The vial in Professor Prince's hand exploded as he clenched his fist.

"I thought you used protection charms..." Vladmir said, taking the bloody hand and removing the glass shrapnel with a motion of his wand.
The potion reacted with blood, so Severus washed it off with water, before casting a basic healing spell.

"I do.
However, my magic is... unpredictable when we discuss sensitive subjects."

Vladmir nodded and looked at Severus Prince's dark eyes.

"He has avoided me since out... confrontation.
I asked for answers.
He gave me this detestable gaze while saying it was for my protection.
When I asked why, he said someting about the Dark Lord."

"You were 16 when your grandfather died...
You did not have the mark..."

"I did not, but I was already hanging out with Lucius."

"Does Sumbledore know you were part of the Mirage Court at the time?"

"Normally not.
I have been an Occlumens since I was 10, my mother made sure of it before I entered the _Underground_."

"Hey Sev', apparently..."

"... you finished the potion?"

"Merlin! I told you not to call me Sev!" Severus grumbled weakly at the twins, who had just barged in.
It was certainly not the first time he had told them, and the twins had probably done the contrary to hassle him with it."

"Hi Vlad," Fred greeted him, ignoring the pouting professor.

"Sev?" the Russian asked, amused, "you became very close since I was expelled.

"Sure, we declare our eternal love..."

"When he agreed to help us for our projects!" George completed withe a warm smile.

"There you go," Sev' groaned, giving them a vial.
"Go take care of your sister!
Where were we?"

Vlamdir made a face and said the Headmaster's name.

"Right...
In short, according to him, it was just a question of time before I became a Death Eater, and he did not want to give Voldemort the heir's name if I learned it through the Five Families."

"Did it even cross his mind that it could be you?"

"Not that I know of.
And when I asked why he stayed silent after I betrayed the Dark Lord, he told me that he did not think I was able to accept those truths.
I vandalised his office, cast some spells, and gave him my resignation for the end of the year."

"He could not have liked it."

"He did not, he tried all the tricks in the book to kep me her, he even dare tell me that he would need me as a spy if Voldemort came back.
As if I wanted to go back to being tortured by a psycopath every other day!"

"Are you sure he does not know you are Arthur's heir?" Vladmir asked.
"His behaviour to you is quite strange..."

"Not that I know of, but it is true that his urge to keep me in Hogwarts is strange."

"Give the Board of Governors your resignation.
He would have not recourse this way."

"In any case, I have many arguements against me, my lack of pedagogical skills, his meddling in my life and work..." Severus Prince sneered.
"I have been fed up to teach here for a long time, but I had no alternative until know."

"Why?
You are a world renowned Potions Master, you should have gotten a job."

"I applied after the fall of the Dark Lord.
Not research laboratory wanted me, and I did not have the funds to create my own company."

Vladmir said nothing, but the glance he and Severus exchanged was unambiguous.
Dumbledore was probably responsible for all those refusals...

"I will kill him," the Potions Master whispered with an overly sweet voice.
"With a slow, painful and uncurable poison..."

"Wait a bit," Vladmir laughed.

He stood back on the ground when the laboratory door opened again, this time on a pale and shaking Hermione.

"Vlad!"

He barely had the time to catch her that she collasped in his arms, sobbing.
Vladmir tried to comfort her awkwardly trying to understand what she was saying.

Nevile and Draco entered more calmly, followed by Luna, wearing André on her head again, Fawkes cooing with lpeasure in her arms, his beak on her neck.

"Hi Vlad.
I suppose you know for Kevin," Neville whispered, sitting down on the table in the same spot Vladmir was a few minutes before.

"Yes."

"It's my fault," Hermione sniffled.
"I wanted to go the the library, and..."

"It's not your faul Mione," Draco sighed, sitting down on a stool.

"If we hadn't..."

"Hermione, it is not your fault," the Slythering repeated, passing a hand hin his pefectly brushed hair.

The young Muggle-Born sniffled again, and wiped her eyes.

"Maybe we'd be more at ease in the other room," Neville said softly.

Severus mumbled something about invaders, and nearly literally kicked them away, mamkig the Weasley twis laugh.
He returned a few seconds later in the comfortable sofas in the main room, strangely at ease with this group of students that were too clever for their own good.

"Now, tell me what happened," Vladmir said.

"We... we were going to the library, when Kevin heard a voice talking about... about death... again."

Severus searched in his pockets, and got a vialf that he gave Hermione.

Drink, it is a calming potion.
It will do you good.

Hermione did not complain and grank the blue liquid in one gulp, as Neville whispered that she had been on the brink of a panic attack for the duration of dinnertime.
The young lionness breathed in deeply and continued her explanation.

"He immedately understood is was a Basilisk... and orderred me to stop.
For the first time, I also heard the hisses.
I barely realised that Kevin was protecting me, and that the Bloody Baron had appeard.
Thye were both instantly petrified, and I saw greenish blue scales.
I... I was frozen by fear and... and..."

"And...?" Neville softly encouraged her as she started sobbing again.

"She saw the gold of death," Luna dreamily declared, observing Hermione with admiration.
"The Nargles whispered the coming of the licorine, but I did not believe them."

"You crossed the gaze of the Basilisk," VLadmir translated, making the others gasp in astonishment.

"I... the Basilisk moved and...
It approached me... I... saw its yellow... eyes and...
He smelled me... kinda like the... goblin...
He just... turned back after...
I... understood it was not normal so...
I took Kevin's second wand and fled..."

"It's normal, Hermione," Vladmir declared, everyone looking at him without understanding.

"But... I should have..."

"Died?
No magical creature can harm you."

"Why?" she asked mournfully.

"Do you remember our detention in the Forbidden Forest, last year?"

"Yes."

"You helped a unicorn..."

"I... I just watched it died in my arms!"

"Unicorns are the purest magical creatures," Severus observed.
"If the unicorn died against you, it is because you are undeniably a pure virgin."

Hermione blushed and lowered her eyes at the mention of her virginity, making the Potions Professor sigh.
A twelve-year-old was usually a virgin!

"Wait, Hermione has a strong potential for Dark magic," Draco intervened.
"I thought Dark Magic and unicorns were incomatible?"

"Dark magic is not bad in essence, even if some spells are particularly dangerous and lethal.
Intentions matter a lot," Severus explained, carefully observing Hermione.
"Did the unicorn do something in particular, like touching you with its horn while dying?"

Hermione simply nodded, as the Potions Professor opened his eyes wide from surprise.

"Merlin!
Although Circe or Morgann are more appropriate," he smiled softly.

"Er... Godfather, are you okay?" Draco asked, looking at the Potions Professor still smiling with a silly face.

"He is, and he is right, Draco," Vlamdir laughed.
"Circe and Morgann are more appropriate because Hermione is like them.
Mione, unicorns do not accept human contact in general, except with very few people.
You shouwed it how empathetic you were by crying for it while it was dying, and it gave you the most precious gift in the world...
It blessed you."

"When it touched me with it's horn?" Hermione asked.

"Exactly .
You are what we call a Dame à la Licorne, a licorin."

"Dame à la Licorne?
That's the name of a famous French wall hanging, I saw it last year when my parents and I visited the Musée de Cluny in Paris," Hermione hisperd, completely lost.

"I am surprised of your knowledge in the matter of French arts," Severus responded.
"Those tapestries wre made by the Goblins Manufacture [1].
This factory is not named like this for nothing."

"You mean...
Real Goblins created those tapestries?"

"Indeed.
Us wizards and witches tend to forget that Goblins are not solely bankers.
There are many extremely skilled artisans in their people, specialised in jewlery or everything else.
They represented one of the most sacred being in our magical society," Severus explained.

"By blessing you, the unicorn made you a fully-fledged magical creature, Hermione.
You inherited many gifts in addition to your initial magic, which allows you to still access so-called 'Dark' magic.
You are sacre for most magicle peoples, and no creature can harm you.
Your blood will heal all wounds, the Basilisk will never attack you and could never wound you, a vampire will never try to drink your blood, a vella will never try to seduce you..."

"Why...
Why didn't you say anything?" Hermione whispered.

"Because you will be lusted after," Neville whispered in response.
"Vlad was right to hide everyone your nature.
The Dames à la Licorne are among the most pwerful witches of all time, as were Morgann and Circe, and they were also a trophy."

"Excuse me," Hermione yelled out, "I am not..."

"Mr Longbottom used the wrong word," Severus groaned.
"You are not a trophy, but you will bring your future husband's people prestige and protection."

"I am not sure I understand," the young girll whispered, slightly paling at the idea of a wedding.

"You are still too young, but as soon as you turn 16 and your nature is revealed, you will be sought after, in all possible ways," Vladmir said.
"For now, I made the Goblin Lord of England not to reveal your nature, but he only negociated his silence until you are legally old enough to marry.
As for the Clan Kemenov vampires, they will not say anything."

"God," Hermione moaned.
"Why me?"

"Thanks to this, you are alive," Luna whispered, smiling.
"It is the greatest gift from magic."

Hermione did not answer, and exhaled deeply.

<hr>

"Why are we in front of the girls' bathrooms, especially those flooded and haunted ones?" Draco grumbled a few hours later when they noticed the closed door from which water was flooding.
He was in a bad nood since Vladmir asked him if he was okay.
No, he was not okay!
His mother was repudated, and he learned that she had tried to kill him, even if unvonluntarily.
And he dared ask if he was okay?
Draco knew that in two weeks time, his resentment had only increase, wating for something from his mother.
Until now, she had left him without news, and he wondered if she had ever truly loved him...

"Ginny got rid..."

"The diary in those..."

"Wonderful bathrooms!"

Draco got out of his dark thoughts and looked at the twins.

"Wonderful...
They are haunted by Moaning Myrtle!"

"You don't know how to appreciate good things," Fred smiled.
"You'll see, making Myrtle cry is..."

"Fascinating," George sneered.
"It's why she floods everything."

"So, you want us all to drown," Neville sighed, a lopsided grin on his lips.

"Shush!" Vladmir suddenly whispered, perking his ears.
"In, quick!"

Footsteps could be heard, and they silently entered the bathrooms before putting their ears against the door.

"Not again.
It's the final straw.
More work...
evening...
enough...
Dumbledore!..."

The footsteps went away, and they all sighed before looking at the place.
Moaning Myrtle, whose sobs could be hears since they had entered, had stopped crying and were looking at them from the top of her cubicle.

"What is it, Myrtle?" George asked.

"Are you still here to throw things at me?" the ghost sniffled, floating towards them.

"Why would we throw things at you?" Hermione asked.

"Not you, I know you would not do that," Myrtle sighed, making Hermione blush.
"I was minding my own usiness when someone decided to throw a thing in my face."

"Look at the professional," Fred whispered in Draco's ear, before continuing louder to Myrtle.
"You can't feel it when someone throows things at you, things simply go through you!"

"OF course, let's all throw things at Myrtle," she yelled in a high voice, sobbing again.
In response, water geysers spewed out of the plumbing and the Weasley wins laughed when Draco, entirely wet, looked daggers at them.

"Myrtle, where is this book?" Hermione asked softly, ignoring the three boys' tomfoolery.

"There," the ghost pointed.

"Thank you."

Vladmir approached the book hidden under the sinks, and reached out with his palm to feel the magic.

"Dark Magic," he whispered.
"Don't touch it bare handed."

He used his cape to grasping the object, preferring not to take the risk.
Vladmir carefully opened the diary and noticed the name in dripped ink.
T. M. Riddle.

"It's a Horcrux," he declared.

"Are you sure?"

"Tom Marvollo Riddle was its owner."

"Shit," Neville groaned.
"You sister is possessed by no less than the Dark Lord.
You have bad luck!"

The two twins stopped joking around, suddenly pale.
They looked at Vladmir with hope, praying he could save their little sister.
The Russian sighed when he noted their pleading eyes.

"Listen, I go back home tonight.
I think you will see me at breakfast.
Try not to get yourselves noticed.
Fred, George, don't lose hope, we'll take care of Ginny and this Horcrux."

"You're taking it with you?" Hermione asked.

"No.
We need to to know where the Chamber of Secrets is.
I don't rancy needing to deconstruct the castle brick after brick to find that Basilisk."

Thus, the next morning at precisely half past six, Vladmir and Katya were standing in the entryway of the Great Hall, most Hogwarts students looking at them.

"Young people, may I have your attention please?" Albus Dumbledore aksed, observing his students with good-heartedness.
"Yesterday, the young Kevin Entwhistle was attacked himself.
Vladmir Kemenov, who was suspected to have provoked those attacks, is thus deemed innocent and free to come back to Hogwarts.
You can go back to your table, my boy.
As for your..."

"Hum... Hum..."

"Yes dear Minerva?" Albus wondered why his friend had interrupted him.

The old Professor pinched her lips as she stood up, looking at Vladmir and Katya who had not moved from the door.

"You forget something Albus.
Mr. Kemenov, from the whole of Hogwarts staff, we hope you will accept our humble apologies.
I hope that the damage this case caused you can be reduced.
You are exempted from homework given this week to help you catch up."

Vladmir silently aquiesced, too surprised from the Head of Gryffindor's unexpected intervention, savouring Dumbledore's sudden blush at the same time.
Anger?
Shame?
He did not know, but it was not important...

"As I was saying," the Headmaster continued after he had regained his composure, "some Madrake roots will be ready in a few weeks, once they mature enough."

"Excuse me," Katya suddenly intervened with an amicable smile way more terrifying than a dark glance, "I am surprised by one thing.
Mandrake draught is commercially available.
Why did you not acquire them from certified sellers?"

"They are quite expensive potions, Lady Kemenov," Dumbledore declared with an attractive smile," and we have a skilled botanist and a famous Potions Master to prepare this draught for cheaper."

"Considering the tuition and the excellent financial situation of the school, I am surprised that you would prefer letting a child miss one year of studies to save some money, rather than spend ten Galleons per person.
However, I am merely a guardian, and not Headmaster of your institution.
Vladmir, have a good rest of the school year."

"Thank you, my aunt."

And Valdmir went back to the Ravenclaw table, a large smile on his lips as numerous whispers started when Katya left.
