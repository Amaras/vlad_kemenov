## Chapter 24: The Heir

Kevin observed and memorised everything.
Few people had understood this innated instinct that allowed the young Muggle-Born to record the smallest facts and gestures, and the smallest details in his environment.
It was this ability and his will to learn everything in order to blend in his surroundings that got him into Ravenclaw.

Kevin was not a genius, but he had a gift for observation.
And Vladmir, while learning to know his friend, had quickly understood the advantages it could bring their little group.

Hermione and Kein had numerous points in commin.
They understood each other perfectly without ever talking.
They both never had any friends in their childhood, their memory and ability to learn serving them badly when the other children were looking for stories and play.
Hermione was a young girl from a good family, be she was the target of mockery.
Kevin was a young boy with coal digger parents, he was born in coal and had prayed everyday to be able to leave the sad town of dark-faced people he was born in, and where no one, not even his paretns, had ever understood him.

It was thus pretty natural for the both of them to meet in the library, on the table thathad regularly been theirs and their friends' for the last two years.
The events from the previous night had triggered their thrist for knowledge.

They did not say anything, but their organisation was methodical and efficient.
He went through the shelves, using his incredible memory to retrieve the texts he had already read, while she read every single line that was adjacent to their research subject.

Afteer the incident from the previous night, the Alliance had talked until late at night, looking for answers to their numerous questions.
The main one, the one the whole school was wondering about, was the meaning of 'Heir'...
By discovering the identity of this person, they would know the reasons of the attack, and how to stop them.
Because the message implied that this petrification would not be the last.

The second question was to know if Ginerva Weasley's problem was linked to this mysterious heir.
After all, possession was one of the darkest forms of magic in the world...

The third one was more a speculation.
They were looking for information about Narcissa Malfoy's role in those events.
Draco was deeply worried about the link between the three problems, convinced they were linked together.
And all of them were thinking the same thing...
Another problem was that most students now thought that Vladmir was responsible for this, thinking he was the dangerous Heir who paralysed Mrs. Norris.
The duel had left a deep impression on their minds...

Kevin went through another shelf and distractedly two books, this time about sould possession, before getting back to his train of though.
Vlad was their friend.
Their first friend, actually, for each of the two Muggle-Borns.
He was the only one that saw something other than a labour instrument in them.
The only one who saw their feelings under their intelligence.
The Russian had opened the magical world to them more surely than school ever could have and probably with more possibilities than they could have imagined without him.
Because Hermione never forgot what Vladmir had told her the day of the Sorting Ceremony.

"Half of Muggle-Borns leave the magical world a few years after they graduate."

She had hated him at first, this haughty and arrogant boy who took pleasure in lying to prospective Muggle-Born wizard...
Out of conscience, she had nonetheless investigated this claim, before sadly discovering that Vlamdir Kemenov had not lied...

Kevin, for his part, had quickly understood the reality of the wizarding world by observing the relationships between students.
The barrier between Pure-Bloods and Muggle-Borns was too big for him not to notice and he had drawn a sad conclusion.
The wizarding world would not bring them anything unless they had solid relationships with old families...
And their heirs simply did not socialized with "Mudbloods", the ones they considered as the mire of society.
The future of a Muggle-Born among wizards was null.

Getting closer with Vladmir was not something they had planned, but it had happened, and Hermione and Kevin could only be grateful about it.
Even if the veneers of the magical world became darker than they could had ever dreamt of, following Vladmir, Prince of the Mirage Court, made them alive.
They belonged to a group of friend that accepted them as they were, with their talents and their flaws...
And their future seemed bright, especially compared to what it would have been before.
What would they have done once they left the magical world behind, without any diploma?
Kevin knew...
He would have ended up in the mines, with his five brothers and sisters.
Hermione, meanwhile, would probably have to work in a factory, unless her parents paid for new studies.

Kevin set down another pile of old books in front of Hermione, and looked at the ones she had already finished reading.
He had to admit that she assimilated quite an astronomical amount of information in a miniscule amount of time, browsing the volumes at a breakneck pace.

_Hogwarts Legends_, by Angus Ravenclaw, 1534.

Without sitting down, he read the paragraph had highlighted with a pencil, a discreet circle on the first interesting line that she ereased as soon as she had read the lines.
Sometimes, they both wondered why wizards did not use Muggle inventions more often...

> Hogwarts is full of legends.
> Each founder added their own secret room to the initial architecture of the castle, creating a private space to their image.
> It is said that only the most deserving, or their heirs, would be able to find them.
>
> Rowena created the Room of Requirement, a mythical room able to invoker everything one needs, equally for relaxation, or for research.
> Only the initated can find and summon the room.
>
> Godric installed the Duelling Room deep in the dungeons, able to materialise the most hostile environments for magical combat practice.
> According to rumours, only a powerful warrior is able to find them.
>
> Helga had Magical Greenhouses built under a great dome in the centre of the castle.
> Some say they are close to the Hufflepuff common room, but this House's location is the msot secret of all, and only its students know the truth.
>
> Salazar hid somewhere in the castle a perfectly secure room for his potions experiments, protecting the students from possible explosions.
> Legends say that he had a pet to protect its entrance.
> His decendents only can find his laboratories.

Kevin stopped reading and looked back at Hermione, who pushed two books she had put away towards him.

_Salazar Slytherin, life and work_, by Elizabeth Lawson.

_Magical bloodlines, fron Antiquity to today_, by Myrddin Wyllt.

"Not 'History of Hogwarts'?" Kevin asked with a smile.

"All checked out, with a two-week wait," Hermione distractedly answered, opening a book and pointing to a page.
"Take a look."

Kevin sad down and looked at the magical lines.
It was probably a rare, enchanted book, automatically updating itself.
He easily found Slytherin's name and traced the dozens of lines formed by his descendents.
Kevin frowned when he realized that all but one of his heirs died.
And the remaining name did not please him.

"Hermione, did you read this book?" Kevin asked.

The young girl lifted her head from her reading, pushed back a few strands of her hair behind her ear while shaking her head.
Kevin turned the book towards her, and Hermione slowly followed the line the Ravenclaw pointed to her, before suddenly growing pale.

"That's..."

"Shush," Kevin whispered, looking behind her.
Theodore Nott and Daphe Greengrass sliently arrived, followed by Blaise Zabini, who was as exuberant as ever.
Kevin softly turned the pages to not show this line, and accidently found the page for the Weasleys.
Amused, he showed Hermione, who softly laughed when she noticed that it was an old line, decending from the Malfoys.
And to think that Ronald's resentment towards Draco was growing stronger as time passed, because Draco did not lose an occasion to annoy him...
Did the Gryffindor know they were distant relatices?

"Hello," Theo smiled, reading over Hermione's shoulder.
"May we?"

"Of course," Kevin answered, getting back the book his hands to continue reading it calmly."

"You found a book written by Merlin?" Blaise said, impressed, reading the title of the grimoire as he pushed a rather wobbly pile of books to fit on the table.

"Merlin?" Kevin asked, surprised.

Theo laughed softly, and looked at the two Muggle-Bornds.

"You know, quite a lot of Slytherins like you.
You accept our House without much problems, and you are so in the know of our traditions that we always forget you are Muggle-Borns."

"You don't hate Mudbloods?" Hermione asked.

"No at all, the main problem is the lack of adaptation and acceptation of our society's customs.
Frankly, just notice the reactions from the duel...
Most Muggle-Borns, and even a few Half-Bloods, were disgusted.
But when you ask any Pure-Blood, they'll say that a duel, especially as regulated as it was, and supervised by arbiters and aurors, is perfectly acceptable," Daphe said softly.

"To get back to the initial discussion, Merlin's real name was Myrddin Wyllt, and books from his  hand are rare, all the more if they are enchanted," Theo said.
"Are you interested by magical lineages?"

"We're curious", Hermione vaguely answered.

"Of course, it has nothing to do with this thing about an heir," Blaise said with a smile.

"Of course," Kevin nodded.

"By the way, Vlad was not in Charms lecture," Daphne declared.
"I hope he's okay!"

"He left school for the day.
He has family matters to take care of," Kevin avoided answering directly, as he did not have a reason to explain the Russian tradition of the day of the dead to the Slytherins.
They did not care to know more, like a Gryffindor would have done, and focused on their homework, while the Ravenclaw went away to put away numerous volumes.
The Kemenovs were one of the most influent clans in Russia, its heir probably had strong familial obligations...

<hr>

And the Slytherins, as was Kevin, were not far from the truth.
After spending part of the day talking with Katya about the clan's affaires, Vladmir was sitting on his parents grave, accompanied by Katya, Sergei... and Lucius Malfoy.
The latter, distinguished in his ceremony robe, was pinching his lips while downing his glass of Pure-Ice vodka after the communion with the deceased
This ceremony had impressed him, especially the powerful wave of pure magic coming from the grave at the end, but he did not seem to appreciate the Russian national drink as much as the other three.

"My dear," he said, attentively observing Katya while Vlad broke the bread and was passing it to Lucius.
"As much as I am honoured to take part in such an important event as the celebration of the deceased, I highly doubt you invited me only by friendship.
If friendship can define our relationship..."

"I think we can consider each other as an ally at first," the Kemenov matriarch smiled," but you are not wrong.
We are meeting here for a reason.
This cemetary is free from eavesdroppers, as one can only come here if accompanied by a relative of one of the people buried here..."

"Did Draco inform you of our discussion with one of your family's elves?" Vlad asked, softly swirling the end of his glass of vodka.

"He has," Lucius became gloomy.

Indeed, his son had informed him of the presence of his wife in Russia, although she had told him she would go to the Mauxfois, the French family branch.
Narcissa had deliberatly lied to him, but he was waiting before making her understand that you don't betray a Malfoy.

"What do you know exactly about..."


"It's family matters," the Lord cut short.

"No, it isn't," Vlad softly responded.
Lucius looked at him, surprised that his aunt let him finish the rest of his glass of vodka without saying anything -- Russians definitely were alcoholics -- and looked into the green eyes of the young boy.

"Draco did not tell you anyhting, considering that it was possible your wife intercepted the letter," Katya declared, leaning on the Potters' tomb.

Lucius stayed silent, waiting for the woman to tell him more, thinking about her words.
A few months beofre, Draco would never have imagined that Narcissa could read the letter he sent to him, although she regularly did.
The Lord realised his son was growing up, and that was not to his displeasure.

"Ilyna Saprovna Dolohov, and Felix Demetrovitch Darerine...
Do you know those names?"

"Unfortunately, I do," Lucius nodded.
"Felix was Voldemort's necromancer during the war.
He gave him most of the Inferis.
He fled to Russia when the Dark Lord disappeared.
As for Ilyna...
She was the Lord's lietenant in Eastern Europe...
I think she went to her family's castle in Estonia.

"I did not know he was in contact with Slavic families," Vlamdir whispered for himself.
Lucius heard him, however, and sighed before responding.

"He was.
Slavs have the greatest concentration of Dark families, and the Dark Lord was trying to rally great and powerful families.
Fortunately, he did not have time to!
He was starting negociations, and Ilyna was doing very well...
Though I don't see what this has to do with Narcissa...
Oh! Don't tell me she..."

"She met with both of them during her stay in Russia," Katya declared.

Lucius closed his eyes for a fraction of a second, trying to keep his ideas in order.
What was she doing there?
Why did she meet with two of the most powerful Death Eaters?
She did not even bear the Mark!

"Can I ask you an indiscreet question?" Vladmir asked softly.

Lucius observed the young boy who was staring at him with his big, hypnotic green eyes.
Draco had hidden his friendship with the young Russian from him from the start.
Lucius only discovered it during summer break, and he was already in close contact with clan Kemenov...
Although he could not stand James Potter, he strangely appreciated his sister, totally different from him, appart from their physical appearance, as he did for her nephew, a real noble, knowledgeable of his duties as heir...
Totally the opposite of James, in short.

"If you allow me one question in return."

Vlad smilled slightly and nodded.

"Why did you stay loyal to Voldemort?
You were his right hand man, but you preferred dissolving the Underground rather than giving him access to the network..."

Lucius allowed himself to show a pale smile.
Nobody had dared to honestly ask him about this question, even if it was key when you wanted to understand him.

"Everybody makes mistakes...
But everybody deserves a second change.
My mistake was blindly following my father and allowing myself to be marked."

Lucius had received the Dark Mark the day of his graduation, as did several students, including his best friend and confidant, Severus Snape.
But reality was not as rosy as Abraxas Malfoy had told him.
There was no exchange.
There was no feedback.
There was only a master and an opinion...
A master and slaves.

It was what Pure-Bloods were reduced to.
Mere slaves destined to obey and suffer when their master was displeased.

After the murder of an entire family of Muggles, including an adorable three-year-old girl, Lucius had focused his attention on the Underground.
He had been a member since he was fifteen years old, introduced to this environment by Severus, whose maternal branch of Princes was a Master family specialized in Potions--unsurprisingly--, and he had climbed the rank ladder up to becoming a Triad.

To stay alive, as you only go out of the Death Eaters feet first, he had pretended to work for Voldemort inside the Mirage Court.
His double dealings had allowed him to get inside the inner circle of Death Eaters, then Voldemort's right hand man...
Until he learned that the Dark Lord, he ignored how, had discovered the identity of the two other Triads and had them executed, in order to put him at the helm of the Underground...

"I used two true facts to cnvinced them I could not use the network for his benefir after the disappearance of Orion Black and Julius O'Summers.
First, the identity of its members was secret, and I could not approach them discreetly, and second, that for a Mirage Court to be legitimized by the International Council of Courts, there needeed to be three Triads."

"It's true that the International Council would have dissolved the Underground if you had stayed alone as a leader."

Vlad thoughtfully observed the English Lord.
Each Court's Triads met together in an International Council to supervise the whole world's Courts discreetly.
It only intervened in rare circumstances, but each one of those was memorable... when not downright shocking...
Lucius had briliantly manipulated the Dark Mage with this detail, but something bothered him.

"Orion Black...
Was he from your wife's family?"

Lucius felt as if he had been struck by lightning.
Up until then, he had never linked Narcissa to Voldemort, and had thus never suspected her of betraying Orion...
However, what he had learned recently had changed things a lot.

"Blacks were and Master branch specialized in intelligence," the Lord said with a blank voice.
"Narcissa knew her uncled was a Triad."

"And if she had denounced Orion, he could have been tortured until he told about O'Summers...
One more thing, how did you manage to convince Voldemort you ignored the names of the other two Triads?" Katya asked.

"I was the last one in, and in some Courts, the youngest Triad ignores the identity of its elders."

"Mostly in Asian Courts, though," Vlad said, wondering.

"The Dark Lorst did not know that," Lucius responded with a sneer.

"Sly and cunning."

"Slytherin," the blond man retorted, making Vlad roll his eyes.
Hogwarts Houses were too important for English wizards, even worse than a resume!

"A tad bit sentimental as well," the boy snickered, "can I call you Hufflepuff?"

The Lord's offended face made the Russians smile, before Lucius understood that Vladmir was mocking him.
Lucius noted that this sneer emphacised the thin scar on the boy's cheekbone, the one that intringued bith him and Draco since they saw Vladmir's naked torso getting treatment from Hogwarts' nurse.
She had spent numerous hours on the two duellists, barely saving the mercenary that had been weakened by the blood loss he had sustained.
The young Russian had several scars, most if not all from Dark spells and quite impressive.
None of them were as thin or discreet as the one on his face, which should have disappeared with appropriate treatment.
It thus probably had a personal significance for him to want to keep it.

"This scar... where does it come from?"

Vladmir's face went blank, and he distractedly caressed the small puffiness, looking at the sky above them.

"I was nine...
I used a moment of inatention from Ju-ie, my nanny, to go play on the Neva quays.
A man took that opportunity to kidnap me...
A Muggle, who thought--rightly so-- that I was a rich heir.
He hit my face to knock me out, and I got this scar and quite the scare.
Sergei found me a few minutes later.
Since then, each time I do something outside, at least one person knows where I'm going and who to contact in case there is a problem.
And I'm always on the lookout.

"It's the only time you disobeyed, Kitten," Katya smiled, as Sergei, who had not talked at all since their discussion began, walked towards him to pass his hand through Vladmir's hair.
"I was happy that you immediately understood the dangers."

Lucius thought about his own son.
At nine years old, Draco threw tantrum after tantrum, convinced he was entitled to everything as heir to the Malfoy family.
It was about the age at which he realised that spoiling and overprotecting his son was not a good idea, especially if he wanted to make him a sensible man.
It had taken him a while to make up for the damage done, but he seemed successful, seeing the friendships his son had in Hogwarts.

"We have another problem with your wife," Katya sighed.
"She introduced a Dark magic artefact in the school.
Something evil enough that Dobby crashed into my home to dissuade Vladmir from returning to Hogwarts this year."

"Do you know what it is?" Lucius asked sombrely.

"Not yet," Vladmir admitted.
"My friends and I are working on it.
We have a lead, however."

Lucius Malfoy stood up and dusted his robes, and the three Russians followed.
He nodded respectfully to Vlad, who nodded back with a slight smile, then he shook Sergei's hand, before gallantly kissing Katya's hand.

"I will not harm Narcissa until I know the ins and outs of this case.
However, I will make sure her every gesture are monitored.
If she meets another Death Eater, I will contact you."

On those last words, Lucius left with a swirl of his cape that strangely reminded him of the Potions Professor's.

Vladmir leaned on the tomb, and put his head on Katya's shoulder, while Sergei got himself comfortable in front of them.
The traditional candles shone brightly and small snowflakes started falling.
Contrary to Lucius, who had kept his heavy fur-lined cape during their conversation, the three Russians had taken off their coats since the beginning, used to the cold.
Those were laying underneath them, protecting them from the glacial marble.

Sergei reached out with his hand and gather a few snowflakes that he observed for long minutes before letting them fall.
His body temperature was identical to the ambiant air's, and it was close to the freezing point of water now.
He raised his head and looked at the Kemenovs with a smile.
Vlad had fallen asleep and Katya was watching the snow fall.

"*The first snow of the year...*"

Sergei nodded.
The first snow was significant for Slavic wizards.
The earlier it appeared, the harsher the winter, both in climate and socio-political events.
It still had not fallen in Russia, but it fell here, in England.
This spelled upheaval.

"*Kitten...*"

Vlad's eyelashes fluttered before he slowly opened his eyes as Katya cautiously shook him awake.

"*Has the first snow fallen on Hogwarts?*"

"*Last week,*" Vlad said with a sleepy voice.

"*I think it's time to go back home,*" Sergei whispered while the snow was falling heavily.
They all shook their head and slowly walked out of the graveyard, which was quickly getting covered by a white mantle.

Vladmir, still a bit groggy from his unexpected nap and nauseous from the Apparition, barely had the time to take a step in the Hogwarts entry hall before Kevin took him appart.

" _Blimey Vlad, we have a problem... A big problem,_" the young Muggle-Born hissed in a low voice.

" _Why Parsletongue?_" the Russian wondered.

"Walls have ears," Kevin groaned in English, looking at the Headmaster passing by a few metres away.
" _Bloody Legilimens._"

" _Did he breach your barriers?_" Vlad asked worriedly, as the penetrating gaze of the Headmaster settled on both of them.

" _No, but he tried all evening on Hermione.
He noticed the disapperance of something in the library and accused both me and Hermione.
He has no proof, and Madam Pince strongly reprimanded him for starting rumours._"

Hermione and Kevin were the librarian's favourite students, so Vlad was not surprised she had taken their side, even against the Headmaster.

" _Are you for something in the disappearance?_"

Kevin did not answer, and lead his friend through the corridors, using several detours to check if they were not monitored before stepping in the Alliance HQ.

Hermione, Draco, and Neville were already there, leaning over a thick book.
Not a word was uttered, and they pushed the book in front of him.
Reading the title, the Russian knew they had the book stolen in the library, and why Dumbledore was furious.
Not only it was written by Merlin, but it was a register of the British wizarding bloodlines.
Vladmir looked at Slytherin's family tree with surprise.

"Why Slytherin's?"

"The use of the word 'heir'...
We are in Hogwarts, it has to be one of the Founder's descendants."

"And because it's a basilisk, it has to be his line," Neville added.

Vladmir let his sight glide over the names, some famous, some not so, until he saw the last two.
Under the name of Tom Marvolo Riddle was linked by right of conquest the name of Vladmir Vassilievitch Kemenov, né Potter.

"Who's Tome Marvolo Riddle?" Hermione asked after a heavy silence.

"He's known as Lord Voldemort," the Russian grimaced.
"This fucking extoplasm ruins my life since the beginning!"

His friends grew pale as they realized that, once more, the Dark Lord was probably linked to Hogwarts' problems.
Vladmir was furious, swearing in several languages on his bad karma that followed him for Hallowe'en and the Day of the Dead, evoking stories about bad omens and first snows that left his friends wondering.

"I have not found annything about the Chamber of Secrets..." kevin eventually whispered, getting his friend's attention on the current problems.
"I think we have to get a copy of _Hogwarts: a history_, it's the only place there could be information about it."

"I have already sent an owl for my mother to send me our library's copy," Draco interected.
"It should arrive tomorrow morning.
However, there are rumours in my common room saying it was open once already and that a student was dead.
According to thme, Mudbloods will be the heir's primary enemies."

"With the stories of Salazar Slytherin's intolerence, it's possible their goal is the elimination of Muggle-Borns in the school...
But Mrs. Norris?" Vladmir wondered.

"Flich is a Squib.
Some consider them as worse than Muggle-Borns.
Maybe he was the target?" Neville intervened, knowing full well what he was talking about.
He had made other people believe that he had only as much magical powers as a Squib when he was a child, and he still got mockery about his status, strenghened by his psudo-shyness and lack of confidence that he tried to keep in public.

"Hermione, Neville...
You have History of Magic tomorrow, right?" Kevin asked.

"Yeah!" Hermione exclaimed.
"We'll ask Binns if he knows anything!"

"By checking what he'll say against _Hogwarts: a History_, and the Slytherin rumours, we should get to know what happened...
Draco, could you get to know when the Chamber of Secrets was opened?"

"Are you afraid it happened when Voldemort was in Hogwarts?" Neville worried.

"Indeed, he was the last legitimate heir, and I did not open this Chamber, I can swear it on my magic."

"We believe you Vlad," Draco sighed.
"We're probably the only one, actually, but we trust you.
By the way, you massacre your enemies in public, not while hidden behind a mythical creature," the blond sneered, bringing smiles on his friends' faces.

"Oi!
It's my role to lighten the mood," Kevin took offence," you're the one supposed to ruin in, you sinister Snake!"

This time, everyone laughed as Draco childishly stuck out his tongue at the Ravenclaw.

"We know Voldemort did not die last year," Vladmir continued softly.
"If he opened the Chamber of Secrets, then he can do it again... and I don't want to see my friends die."

'Not again', Vlad thought, looking at Kevin and Hermione.
The firve friends fell into a memditative silence for long minutes, until they jumped when the door suddenly slammed open.

"Merlin, what..."

"Dark mood coming out..."

"Of this room! Fortunately we're here..."

"To raise your spirits!"

The Weasley twins walked into the HQ, and sat down around the table, as Hermione smiled at them.

"How's Ginny?" Neville asked.
"She was not here today."

"If you tackle all the tough subjects, I understand your mood," Fred sighed.

"She spent the day in the Hospital wing," George added.
"According to Percy, she fainted in Potions class.
I would have said that the greasy bat was responsible for it, but she was so weak that he has no fault in it.
Madam Pomfrey said that she was only exhausted."

Vladmir was surprised when he saw Neville grow pale and clench his jaws, as if something the Weasley twin said made him uneasy.

"However, there are two good things," Fred sighed, not realising that Vlad had stopped listening.
"She got a visit from a slightly 'out there' Ravenclaw blonde girl..."

"Luna Lovegood?" Kevin asked.
"She's peculiar, but she has a gift when it comes to understanding people.
If she was with your sister, Ginny needed that."

"What about the second thing?"

"Percy finally took our warnings seriously.
You missed Mom's Howler arrived by express owl.
For once, she said that he should have listened to us!"

"We tried to save it to immortilise the moment, but we failed," his twin chuckled.
"I think she doesn't know that Ron has become our favourite test subject since a few days ago.
He has spent quite a bit of time in the Hospital wig, though."

"Why?"

"We like Hermione and Neville, and our brother--and I'm ashamed to call him that--spends his time insulting and berating them because they are more open-minded than them and don't see the world in black and white.
He tends to forget that the range of grey inbetween is huge...
It's time he put Goblin money in his brain instead of the Leprechaun gold he already has.

"What about the diary?" Vlamdir eventually asked, going back to the conversation after Neville reassured him with a hand gesture.

"We'll try taking it tomorrow morning, when all the girls will be gone to breakfast.
Ginny is spending the night under the Dragon's guard, she won't be able to get it before us."

They all nonned, and Kevin advised them to drop it off in the HQ once they got it.
It would be protected, and Ginny could not get it back.
They finally went back to their dormitories, but Vlad held back his Gryffindor friend by his sleeve and waited for the others to go out before looking at him.

Neville had kept the bloolines book against him, considerably paler than usual.

"Nev', are you alright?
You look quite pale."

"Vlad... we believed the Prince line to be extinct," Neville whispered.

He held out Merlin's book towards him, opening to a specific page.

The Russian's eyes widened when he read the last name.

"Do you think Dumbledore knows?" Neville whispered again.

"I don't know...
I prey that he does not.
Before anything else, we need to talk to _him_."

Under the name of Eileen Prince, glowing with a golden yellow signifying that the heir was alive, a name appeared.
_Severus Tobias Snape._
