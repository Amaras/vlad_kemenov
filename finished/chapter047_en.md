# Chapter 47: Mages and Dark Magic

Neville Franck Longbottom softly pushed Mary-Ann behind him to hide her with his body in case of a problem.
They were both hiding away in the in a thick undergrowth, safely sheltered.
Neville did not know where the others were, but Kevin had entrusted his sister to him, and he did not want to fail to protect her.

Slowly, shushing the young girl, he pulled his father's wand from his pocket, brushing a Galleon he was squeezing tightly in his other palm.
But not any Galleon, the Alliance one…

He looked around, the thick and dark forest that surrounded them, the cries of fear and the explosions that came to their ears through the vegetation, and checked that the barriers he had errected were quite efficient at hiding them from undesirabled.
Then he closed his eyes and focused on his best friend's face.

«Vlad?» he called mentalled.
The response arrived quickly, to the Gryffindor's satisfaction.
He had to think about thanking Hermione and Kevin for what they had managed to do with mere Galleons.

«Nev… are you safe?»

«Yes.»

«Is Pap with you?» Kevin suddenly asked, interrupting the conversation between the only two official members of the Mirage Court.

«Yes,» Neville repeated without a trace of exasperation.
The young girl was very endearing and it was obvious that Kevin loved her.
The Muggle-Born had talked about his sisters several times during the three years they had spent together, but he had never given any detail on their relationship.
They Ravenclaw was deeply protective towards his little sisster, which had made the Alliance give him a new nickname and give him slightly envious looks.
Hermione, Vladmir, Draco, and Neville were all only childrend and had a quite solitary childhood, despite their very loving families.

«What is happening on your side?» Hermione asked in turn.

«A group of Death Eaters is enjoying burning down tents and torturing the campsite owners,» Kevin answered.
«Seriously, no one dares fight them?»

«Don't worry Kevin, some wizards still are courageous.
They are about to get kicked in the butt by my father, and I think I have seen Katya with him… and Sirius as well,» Draco added with a touch of worry… for the Death Eaters and himself.
He did not want to witness a massacre, and he knew the adult Malfoy-Kemenov duo would do serious damage.

«Well, they saw us first,» Vlad grumbled.
«Kevin, to the forest!»

«I see you Mione,» Draco said at the same time.
«I'm coming towards you, don't move!»

«See you!
Nev', be careful!
There are people going to the forest,» Hemione pointed out.
She had been hiding with several mothers and young children.
She had been separated from her friends a few minutes earlier, when the attack had started.

«Are you safe?» Neville asked.

While Hermione and Draco, who had just got to her, responded in the affirmative, two groans could be heard.
Vladmir and Kevin were in a bad situation after the latter had started being chased by a dozen Death Eaters.
The conservative Pure-Bloods had not appreciated the important status a mere Muggle-Born had been given, and they were fighting with the students at the edge of the forest.
Dark Magic spells flew from both sides…

The other members of the Alliance, who were all in the main tent when the attack started, were not idiots.
Their position, at the edge of the huge campsite that welcomed spectators and party goers for the Quiddtich World Cup was the assailants' tartet, and the Alliance had one rule in situations like this: run if the enemy is unknown.
Thus they had all fled to the woods before realizing that they were Death Eaters.
Kevin and Vladmir, however, were visiting the Wealseys, whose tent was in the middle of the campsite.
They were less lucky and had been pushed right inside the clash.

The young Logbottom stood up and gestured for Mary-Ann to follow him.
They had to move before they faced a group of nostalgic Death Eaters.
Neville preferred avoiding to get next to his parents in St-Mungo and especially, that Mary-Ann got hurt.

The day had started perfectly, and yet… Neville thought.
After had met with the rest of the Alliance, as well as André‑who had transforme into a top hat on Draco's head‑and Fawkes‑transofrmed into a huge butterly on Mary-Ann's shoulder‑they had gone to the ministerial boxs.
Having such high-ranking parents had many advantages they made the most of.

A pleasant surprise waited for them, also source of amusement: the Weasley family were already in the ministerial boxes.
They had not yet realized that the group of Lord regnants and future Lords had arrived, too busy talking amongst themselves.
However, to the Alliance's disappointment, the only missing brothers were the twins Fred and George.

"Is it just me, or do they have better robes?" Draco noted, turning to his father.

"Arthut had a promotion after Fudge fell.
Apparently, he had blocked Arthur's advancement for political reasons.
He is now Head of the Service of Misappropriation of Muggle Crafts."

"For political reasons?" Hermione repeated, surprised.

"Arthut is known to be a discreet Liberator.
That is why he loves Muggles and their inventions.
However, I would bet my wand that he votes as a Moderate," the man added, thoughtful.
"He knows a lot about the magical world and its traditions, and above all, he does not want to see them disappear.
You only need to see the education he gave his children.
However, Molly is a fervent Liberator.
Fudge was afreaid that giving political force to a family like them would give him trouble in the long run."

As Lucius finished his explanation, the Weasley twins joined the stands with Cedric, the three of them having a small smile that quickly grew when they saw the rest of the small friend group.
Well, small… not so small when you actually counted the four Gryffindors, the two Ravenclaws, their favourite Slytherin and the Hufflepuff, current captain of the his Quiddtich team, not to mention the newcomer…

"Your sister?" Cedric immediately asked, a huge smile on his lips.

"Yes, Mary-Ann, this is Cedric, and the twins Fred and George."

"Who is Fred and who is George?" the young Entwhistle asked, curious.

Vlamdir pointed the right twins and Mary-Ann looked at them intentely before laughing when they started their habitual buffoonery.
Gred and Forge were unhinged and exchanged spots quickly for a few minutes before…

"So, which am I?" the first twin asked with a falsely innocent face.

"George," Mary-Ann did not even hestitate.

The two twins looked at each other, blindfolded her and did it again… no less than three times before they realized that Kevin's little Butterfly managed to differentiate them without any mistake.

"Merlin, how do you do it?" Fred was horrified.

"Even our mother gets it wrong…"

"… half the time!"

"Fred is taller, and George has a rounder face," Mary-Ann answered with a smile.
"And he is fatter, as well!"

The match started as the small group was laughing out loud, and George spent several hours protesting that he was not fat.

His friends lifted up his mind with the bets the Alliance had put in place with the whole student body of Hogwarts during the last school month.
Neville remembered well the time the twins and Cedric had put to finalize the details of the bets, from simple predictions of the quarter-finals down to the exact score of the World Cup final.
They had created for this occasion a communicating parchment system tht updated every day.
The documents were hidden under tons of protection spells created by Hermione and Kevin, with a few surprising by really interesting ideas from Luna.
Only the betters written down on Fed and George's special parchment could see the data evolve as the matches progressed.

And tonight, they would finish their accounting, and they would probably become way richer…

Neville was brought back to earth when he head a stick break a few metres away.
He felt Mary-Ann's hand grip his robes, as he raised his wand.
The stick and leaves breaking noises started again, this time way closer.

Neville pushed the young girl between his back and a tree, and raised his father's wand, before seeing a small, visibly scared, House Elf appear.
Appartently, Neville's shields worked, because she did not seem to be able to see them.
However, it was pbvious that she was not alone, judging by the way she was walking, as if an invisible hand was pulling her backwards.

"Bad wizards!" she squeeked.
"Winky does not want to stay here!"

She was harshly struggling against the unknown forced that was pulling her, which made Neville frown.

"_Hominum revelio_," he whispered.

The complex motion of his wand revealed a silouhette a few meters away, hidden under an invisibility cloak.

"_Accio invisibility cloak_," he said as softly.

The stranger's reaction was sharp and Neville wand jumped form his hand, responding to a nonverbal spell.
The man in front of him, uncovered, was familiar.
Thin, nervous, face marked by harships, and this particular twitch…
In a caracteristic crack, the small House Elf disappeared, terrified and finally free from the hand that was holding her back.

"Crouch," the Gryffindor growled with fierce hatred as his shields were falling under the spell load.

This twitch was only found in one wizard he knew… Bartemius Crouch Jr., one of the people responsible for the state his parents were in.

"If that is not young Logbottom," the Death Eater whispered before pointing Neville's wand to the sky.
"_Morsmordre_!
You saw me… I must thius kill you…
Or maybe should I give you the same fate as your parents?
It will bring back such good memoires!"

The wizard fell silent, then added with a pang of surprise in his voice.

"You don't seem surprised to see me…"

Neville did not answer, observing the Dark Mark in the sky with a sick fascinated as he stayed immobile, hiding Mary-Ann behind his ample robes and discreetly put his true wand in his hand, withhout being seen by the Death Eater.
How he hated this mark that had indicated where his parents were after they were tortured…
How he hated this skull and this snake…
But not as much as he hated the Lestranges and Crouch Jr.
Slowly, Crouch started to smile a he was still not attacking him, still contemplating the student.

"Isn't it beautiful?" the wizard finally sighed, seemingly for himself, under Neville's carefully gaze, who finally saw the first muscles stiffening, for now not perceptible by the Death Eater.

"I am impatiently waiting for the Master to return," Crouch continued, his motion slower.
"I would have loved to bring him a prestigeous death, and here you are, one of the Boy-Who-Lived's best friend.
_Avada Ke_…"

He suddenly fell silent when he realized that he could not move his arm.
In front of him, Neville then smiled twistedly, a smile that even rvaled Vladmir's best ones.

"Already parayzed…" the Gryffindor analyzed.
"Well, I don't think you'll live for more than five minutes…"

"What…?"

Neville moved his hand to show his own wand, and smiled before gesturing towards Mary-Ann, whose eyes were opened wide at what she saw.

"Don't look," he whispered to her, thinking that she had already seen too much.
To his satisfaction, she obeyed and turned her gaze, as Neville walked to the Death Eater, who had falled to the ground, unable to do any move.
Neville observed with visible pleasure the fear that suddenly appeared in the eyes of the man who was partially responsible for his parents' mental death.

"To respond to your amazement, I am not surprised to see you alive…
My family has sworn a Vow of Vengeance against you.
As for this," Neville declared as he took back his father's wand, "is the property of the Longbottoms, Dukes since the time of Merlin and Artus, and poisonners for the Mirage Court for centuries.
What is happening to you is our ultimate weapon.
A selective poison, based on the magical signature and which enteres the body through the skin.
Longbottoms are naturally immune to it, and the antidote is only known by us.
You will thus die like the piece of shit you are, Crouch.
I would have loved to torture you to get the name of the person who helped you escape, but you probably can't talk already…
Not too painful?"

Neville sniggered as the wizard was starting to convulse and quickly rose up, putting his father's wand in his special holster, hidden in his sleeve.

"Who is that?" Hermione asked in a whisper, appearing at their side, immediately followed by Draco, whose robes were slashed.

"Crouch," the Malfoy heir replied.
"What is this Death Eater doing here?"

"And what are *you* doing here?" Neville wondered.

"We saw the Mark in the sky…" Hermione whispered.
"It's causing quite the panick in the campsite.

"And if we saw it, the Aurors won't be long to arrive," Draco added, carefully looking around.
"Poison?"

The true status of the Longbottom line in the _Underground_ had not been a secret to the Alliance for a long time, at least for the core.
When Cedric and the twins would be offered a spot in the Mirage Court, they would also learn about it, but it was not in question for now.

"Yes.
I wonder how they'll explain it," Neville chuckled.

"You had part of your revenge.

Only the Longbottoms' allies knew that Augusta had made a Vow of Revenge against the Lestranges and Crouch Jr.
When she had learned who was responsible for the torture of her son and daughter-in-law, the worst of the witch had come out and she had made one of the darkest magical Vows.
A Vow that brought the promise of death and whose main advantage was knowing if the targets were still alive.

"Where is Mary-Ann?" Hermione worried, looking around her.
Between the corpse and the attack's violence, the young girl must be afraid!

Neville turned towards the tree sheltering Kevin's young sister and he smiled when he saw that she had obeyed him well.
Shuffling to her side, he kneeled and pulled a hand in her long brown strands.
She was shivering slightly and seemed cold, but as he looked into her blue eyes, Neville understood that she was of Kevin's calibre.

"Is he dead?" she asked.

"Yes."

"Would he have hurt us?"

"He would have killed us," Neville agreed.

"Then it serve him right!" mary-Ann explained, petting the giant antenna of the butterfly who was actually Fawkes.

"You can't talk about it, though," Neville whispered.

"Our secret?"

The gryffindor smiled at her and softly reached out his hand to delicately wrap her wrist.
He explained to her that simple magical oaths were materialised by a particular handshake.
They did not use magic, only the honour of the people in presence, a very important thing for magical families.

"It is our secret," he assured her.
"Ours and our friends', okay?"

Then he helped the young girl stand up, at the exact moment when twenty or so wizards and witches wearing red robes appeared around them, wands raised.

None of the Alliance members took the time to think.
They threw themselves to the ground with their wands out, as spells were flying over their heads, making strong wind gusts under the power of the spells.

"_Protego maxima_," the three students simulateneously screamed, placing themselves strategically around the young girl.

"Stop!" a voice they all recognised yelled.
"It's my son!"

"And my grandson," another scathing voice added.

The three students sighed with relief as Lucius and Augusta went through the lines of Aurors.

"Are you alright children?" Augusta worried, focusing on Mary-Ann, tremmbling in the middle of the protective sircle the others had created.

"It's alright, Madam," Kevin's young sister answered in a shaky voice, tears in her eyes.

"Move aside, Lucius," a voice said sryly.

Neville and Draco immediately recognised the person and the first held back a swear, sculpting his face with the same cold mask the young Malfoy heir wore.
They could not have a worse person to speak to.

"Which one of you did this?" the man roared, carefully looking at the three students safely behind the two adults, his gaze staying on Draco the longest, who cursed the prejudice and his father's past.

"None of us," Hermione replied calmly.

"Don't lie!
You are the…"

"It is not the case," Neville cut him sharply, anjoying in advance the man's reactions.
"However, we came across you son's corpse, maybe he is responsible for it.
After all, he was a Death Eater, and he is supposed to be buried in Azkaban's cemetary, is he not, Mister Crouch?"

The male quickly paled, looking for the corpse, which Hermione eventually pointed to.

"It is embarassing," Amos Diggory declared with a smirk.
"Please releave me of this doubt Bartemius, you have nothing to do with your son's surprising appearance, have you not?
After all, as Mister Longbottom explained it so clearly, he is supposed to be buried in Azkaban's cemetaray, after you formally identified him…"

The Head of the Department of International Cooperation of the Ministery for Magic was pale as a ghost as he shook his head to refuted, but Neville strongly doubted the truth of this statement.
And judging from the looks of the other people, even the Aurors had serious doubts.
Crouch would probably be referred to the Department of Magical Law Enforcement…

"He does not have a wand," one of the Aurors who had approached the corpse declared."

"He cannot have cast this specific spell without a wand," Lucius declared, getting wary looks from the others.
"I am not proud of what I was forced to do in the past, the least thing I can do is help you as well as I can."

"You could have taught your son," Crouch declared in frustration.

"Mister Malfoy, would you agree to the use of the Prior-Use spell on your wand?" Amos Diggory asked calmly.

All expected the Malfoy heir to refuse and were ready to attack, especially since it was obvious that the student had fought before, his clothes were ripped and slightly stained with blood.
Draco simply had a small smile as he reached out his wand, quickly followed by Neville and Hermione.

"_Prior Incantato_," Amos Diggory whispered, putting the tip of his wand to the young Malfoy's own.

Slowly, a pale red light appeared, with the associated incantation over it.
As he had not seen anything, the wizard gave his property back to Draco and apologizing under Lucius Malfoy's furious gaze.
Hermione's and Neville wands did not show any more, since they had not used their official wands, only their family's, or Hermione's illegal one…

"Now you are sure we acted in good faith, there was an Elf with him, and she fled when we appeared."

Neville's choice of words was perfectly thought out to be exact, but slightly arranged to show his truth.
The Gryffindor was not worried about the ability of the Elf to recognise her immediately.
After all, if Crouch summoned the Magical Creature now, it would implicitely admit to his implication, and while the Aurors and Ministry officials would fix the security problems on the campsite, the Mirage Court would have time to get their hands on the House Elf.
"Are you sure," Crouch slowly asked.
This piece of news seemed to make the man even more livid, if it was possible.
Now the three students were ready to bet their whole net worth that the man knew perfectly well that his son was still alive, and the the Elf was one of his own.

"I swear on my magic."

A short-lived halo surrounded Neville, who cast a little _Lumos_ to prove we told the truth.

"Thank you children, you can go," Amos Diggory sighed, looking disappointingly at Draco.

"Thank you Sir," the Draco replied with an amused smile, easlity guessing that the man was raging for not being able to shame the Malfoy family.
An old rivalry existed between the two men, who had long fought over a position in their youth, and the pseudo-control of Minister Fudge.

Without further ado, the four children went back to the ir parents, and Hermione reassured Mary-Ann, knowing perfectly well that the young girl was still shocked by the murdered and the accusations.
Eleven was still a bit young to be implicated in their business…

"Did you kill him?" Augusta asked in a whisper, calmly walking next to her grandson between smoking tents and gaping craters.
She had felt Crouch Jr.'s death thanks to the Vow of Vengeance.
Lucius was intently listening to the conversation, making sure no one else did.

"I did.
Homebrew."

"So undetectable.
Congratulations, my boy," Augusta smiled as she tapped Neville's shoulder.
"Did the Elf see you?"

"I am not sure, but I will say yes just in case."

"We'll need to ask Katya whether we can borrow Ubista's talents," Lucius said.

"She was a Crouch family House Elf.
He will soon summon her to get her version," Draco agreed.

"In this case, get back to the others, I'll go to Katya immediately," Augusta sighed, before Disappearing.

"Aren't there supposed to be anti-Apparition spells?" Hermione asked, surpirsed.

"You should know that Courts have their own tricks, Mione," Neville smiled at her.
"Especially Triads."

Hermione mumbled something before seeing a brown tornado run past her.

"Pap!"

Mary-Ann got squished agaist her borther's chest and she reflexively did what she did earlier and passed her arms around his neck, crossed her legs around his waist, and nestled her nose in his neck.

"Are you alright?" Kevin worried, surprised that she reacted like that.
Since he was in Hogwartes, she had not snuggled to him like that.

"Yeah.
Neville is great," Mary-Ann whispered.

Neville blushed slightly at the compliement and thankful look from his Muggle-Born friend.
Vlamdir was standing slightly away, looking at the tree cover a hundred metres away, still wary.

"The Dark Mark was cast by Crouch," Neville declared while Hermione and Kevin were cajoling Mary-Ann.

"The old blockhead of International Magical Cooperation?" Vlad was astounded, looking at his friends.

"No, his Death Eater son," Neville started.

"Old blockhead?" Draco chuckled.

"Ah, more understandable," Vladmir murmured.
"He is a true blockhead.
I don't understand how he got to be Head of this department since he had no talent for diplomacy.
I think the last time he went to Russia, he managed to annoying half of the Russian Ministry for International Coorperation.
I also know that the Russian Ambassador to Britain deeply hates hil.
And I'm not even talking about the time when Katya went to your Ministry, he barely avoided a diplomatic incident…"

"You're not surprised that the son was alive?" Hermione asked, surprised and not knowing about the Vow of Revenge by the Longbottoms.

"If you look at the figures, out of the 170 Death Eaters known by the Courts, only five died since the end of the war," Neville added with a dark gaze.
"And they mostly dided of natural causes.
All in all, three quarters are free, the remaining quarter is in Azkaban.
They weren't even Kissed while several people were for lesser crimes."

"So people who deserve capital punishment are free?" Hermione was horrified.

"Look at my father, Theodore Nott Sr., or even Severus," Draco sighed.
"For what they have done, any other wizard would have died.
"However, they are Pure-Bloods or Half-Bloods from powerful lines.
They have money, and hold the economy in their hands.
So ending half the lines would be taking too much of a risk for the British world.
So, they stayed alive, and payed for their freedom…"

"It's…"

"Abnormal," Drco agreed.
"On the one hand, I could live with my parents, like many other Hogwarts students, but on the other hand, it's a flagrant injustice, and especially an insult to Magic."

"What do you mean?" Kevin cocked up his head.

"The Ministry considers that without Pure-Bloods, the magical world would end.
It's wring.
The most powerful wizards and witches of our centuries are Muggle-Borns and Half-Bloods.
Magic needs mixing to be powerful, but most Pure-Bloods forget it…"

"Morgan," Hermione whisper.
"I would have thought Vladmir would be the one to say somehting like that, not you."

"I have had time to reflect, Mione," Draco sniggered.
"I observed, analyzed, decuced.
I even went throught the whole Manor library to get my hand on the oldest treaties on Magic."

"How is the tent standing up?" Mary-Ann asked wondered suddenly in her brother's arms.

Indeed, in the middle of the field of ruins that used to be a campsite, only the Kemenov family tent was standing, unharmed.

"Dark Magci and blood magic protections," Katya answered with a smile.
"Come in, Augusta prepared enough food for a whole regiment!"

Sighing in relief, they went into the tent to sit down around a good cup of hot chocolate, along with a mountain of various biscuitss and cakes.

"When did you have enough time to do all that?" Neville asked his grandmother, mouth agape.

"Magic," the old witch and Hogwarts Headmistress answered, as André, on her head, was laughing at her thoughts.

"Madam, why are you wearing a hat at the table?" Mary-Ann asked timidly, half hiding behind the huge steaming cup when the severe witch turned her attention on her.

"Ah, this, my girl, is a Lady priviledge," Augusta smiled.
"You see, a hat, or any accessory covering your head, is considered as an ornament, and all women can thus keep wearing them inside.
Had Kevin worn any headgear, he would have to remove it before entering the room."

"It is not written in Kev's books," the young girl said, wondering.

"Ah, Kevin's books focus on general etiquette, not fashion question."

"If you want to read them, I will lend you my books," Hermione told her softly.
Augusta had given her a series of complementary books about the link between fashion and wizarding etiquette, more thourough than Kevin's.

"True?
Thanks!" the girl declared with a huge smile.

"Thank you," Augusta corrected her.
"Avoid interjections like 'true', 'seriously', or other things of that kind."

""Thank you, Hermione," Mary-Ann repeated punctiliously, before asking, carefully chosing her words.
"What does 'of that kind' means, Madam?"

"I means 'like that', but more formal."

"Thank you for the information, Madam!"

"You can call me Augusta, Mary-Ann," the witch laughed.
"And I think neither Lucius nor Katya would prevent you from using their first names.
However, you shoud politely ask them before."

"All right, Ma… Augusta."

"Let me talk to our future Hogwarts resident!" André exclaimed, gesticulating.

Augusta rebuffed him for messing up her hair, and delicately put the Sorting Hat into Mary-Ann's arms, who looked at him with deep curiosity.

"I feel you have a question," André smiled.

"André… is that your real name?" Mary-Ann asked softly, looking at the Sorting Hat on her lap.

"Why this question," the venerable artifact, surprise in his voice.

"Well, according to Hogwarts: a History and Kevin, you are almost as old as the school, but André is a relatively recent name," the young Entwhistle explained, getting a few impressed chukles from her elders at her logical argumentation.

"I am named Andrade, Andrade Slytherin.
André is the name my brother gave me.
An old joke between André and Andreas, the name my mother absolutely wanted for me, before she agreed with my father's choice."

"Slytherin…
Like the Founder?"

"Indeed," André acquiesced, nodding his tipe nearly humanly.
"I am… or rather was since his death, his younger brother."

"How did you end up as the Sorting Hat?"

Adrade sighed when he felt everyone's attention turned to him.
They had all wondered about it, but never asked the artifact how it happened.

"Well, as Vladmir knows, I was, during the time of the Founders, Professor of Spiritual Arts, as we commonly called them, do you know what those are?"

"Occlumency and Legilimency," Mary-Ann immediately said with a nod.

"There was third branch, Astralogy.
It consisted in short of mind teleportation in another body, or appearing in an astral form?"

"Like ghosts?" Vlamdir asked with great interest, having never heard of Astralogy.

"Indeed.
Ghosts are either bodyless minds following the death of the body, or people whose mind lost their connection with their body and soul," André answered with smile.

"So, fundamentally, what Voldemort did during our first year was Astralogy?" Hermione asked.

"Exactly, Hermione!
He attached his mind onto Quirell, using additional rituals to physically 'appear' on him.
To get back to my story, I was teaching Spiritual Arts, but during a lecture on Astral Projection, there was a grave accident.
Two students from old families in the middle of a vandetta‑the equivalent of the Russian clan wars‑decided to fight at that exact moment.
I managed to save them both, but it severed by connection to my body.
Salazar and Rowena managed to seal my sould and my mind in a substitution body, a Puli dog.
However, it was one of Godric's Transfiguration experiment, who had transformed one of his old hats into a lively-looking dog…"

Even centuries afterwards, they could detect the murder impluse André had against the Founder.
The silence stretched, until someone started giglin.
They all turned to Kevin, who was wheezing over the table.

"There is nothing funny in there!" the Sorting Hat chocked in fury.

"Sorry André, but… I thought… of… something…" the Muggle-Born tried very hard to breathe.
"Please, don't tell me it is the true reason of the huge argument between Godric Gryffindor and Salazar Slytherin!"

"It is," the Sorting Hat admitted in a grumble, making the Ravenclaw howler in laughter, the others looking at him with amusement in their eyes.

"Yes, laugh," the Sorting Hat mumbled, while Mary-Ann was squeezing him against her with a smile.

"Why haven't you tried to find a new body?" Hermione then asked.

"Because I cannot leave this bind any more.
My mind still can, and it allowed me to continue teaching the Spiritual Arts, but my Soul cannot any more.
If it is ripped from a solid container again, I doubt it would survive.
It was not even supposed to after the first separation…"

"So, you volunteered to Sort the students?"

"I did.
I have always done it," André smiled.
"I used to use Legilimency on the students to determine their main characteristics and I Sorted them, it was part of my job.
The fact that I was a hat did not change much, except I had no magic but my mind's."

"Why did you not have magic any more?" Mary-Ann asked.

"Well, I have to explain the base of Four to you, also known as MSBM," André started as a small House Elf appeared silently, whispered a few words in Katya's ear, then disappeared.

"Never heard of it," Kevin mumbled, as Neville sighed in relief as the Russian witch gave him an appeasing smile.

"MSBM for 'Magic, Soul, Body, Mind,'" Hermione deciphered.
"I read something about it, but it's too abstract to me."

"Simply, every object has a material Body, made of molecules.
Muggles have a better knowledge of this phenomenon…
Anyway…
All living things have the Soul and Body in common, even plants, the soul being this little miraculous thing that allows us to grow and evolve.
Magic differenciates living being in two categories.
Finally, the Mind differentiates thinking things from other others.
Wizards have all four, as do House Elves, or Gnomes.
A Devil's Snare had Magic, a Soul, and a Body.
A Muggle has a Soul, a Body, and a Mind.
Do you understand?"

"In that case…
A vampire had a Body, a Mind and Magic?" Hermione asked after thinking a bit.

"Exactly.
Its Body is dead, and thus so is its Soul.
However, the Body and Mind stay intact becase of its Magic.
That is why vampires always come from magical creatures.
Normally, a sould cannot survive without a solid body…"

"So how did Voldemort survive?"

"Thanks to a Horcrux, a very Dark Magic spell that allows one to bind some of their soul into an intert body," Vlamdir said sombrely.

André immediately noted the Russian's tone of voice.
It was true that he knew exactly what was inside him…

"Tell me, young Mary-Ann…
Are you ready for the start of the school year?" the Sorting Hat asked quickly to turn Vladmir away form his dark thoughts.

"Yes!"
And Mary-Ann started to babble about her school shopping, the Diagon Alley shops, incredible novelties for her…

<hr>

André still thought about Mary-Ann's babble when he Sorted Thomas Edgcombe in HufflePuff, preparing to Sort the younger sister of one of his rare friends.
He could see her in the number of new students, slightly worried by the Sorting, even though he knew that whatever her House, she would be accepted there.
After he had spent hours talking with her, the Sorting Hat knew that she would have no problem integrating.

"Entwhistle, Mary-Ann!"

Mary-Ann could not help but notice that many students suddenly got interested in her, much more than in the other students.
Apparently, kevin was wring.
He was much more infamous than he thought.
After all, learning that he was the first Knight-Mage in centuries had intrigued many wizards and witches.
And angered many others…

As she walked towards André, she heard many whispers, the students trying to work out that she was Kevin's sister.
Without caring much, she sat down on the stool and the Sorting Hat covered her head.

"Mary-Ann!
How are you, little Butterfly?"

"Very well, thank you Andrade," the young girl replied in her mind with a smile.

"Ohh, I see you have done some work since the last time," the Sorting Hat noticed, analyzing the structure of her mind.
Vlamdir and Kevin had made a point to giver her meditation and relaxation lectures to calm down her thought and order her memoires, especially after the venerable artifact had called her mind a real dump.

"I'd say you're constructing a beautiful tropical greenhous.
Butterflies?" André asked.

Mary-Ann blushed and nodded.
She wanted her thoughts to be in the form of butterflies.
Depending on the species and colours, she would know what kind of memories they were, and they would be especially difficult to percieve for potential invaders.

"Excellent idea.
I'll refer you to Professor Prince for that, he is a great Occlumens."

"Can't you help me?" Mary-Ann mumbled.

"Not for now.
I always need some time after a Sorting ceremony to rest and process information.
Talking about sorting…
You know that you will be a Cornelian choice?"

"Will I?" Mary-Ann was surprised.
She had thought, since she had received her letter, that she would be a Ravenclaw like her older brother.

"Ravenclaw would be good for you, indeed, you like knowledge and learning.
However, above that, you are deeply loyal to your brother and indirectly yo Vlamdir and his friends.
You would do a great Hufflepuff, but…"

"But?"

"You are way too harsh for Hufflepuffs.
You are loyal, but even above that, you are ambitious.
Knowledge is power, and you and your brother understand that perfectly.
You are right, Kevin will have a great role in shaping the future wizarding world.
You want to be a part of it, to make him proud and prove to others that even though you are Muggle-Born, you are also a powerful witch.
It will be the first time in a decade I put a Muggle-Born in… SLYTHERIN!"

Mary-Ann barely avoided opening her eyes wide in surprise and turned to the Slytherin table as Ravenclaw and Hufflepuff applauded.
Slowly, Draco stood up and started clapping slowly, surprising the rest of his table, who seemed to be procesing the arrival of a Muggle-Born in their House.

The young girl exchanged a look with her brother and Vladmir, andshe realized that they were both proud of her, in a way.
At the smile that both Gemini gave her, she understood exactly what they expected of her.
Their looks clearly said 'Show them! Show them who you are!'

So, slowly, Mary-Ann breathed in, looking for the etiquette lessons in her mind, and slowly walked towards the Slytherin table, a fine smile on her lips.

"Mary-Ann, it is a pleasure to have you at my table" Draco smiled, slightly sitting aside, voluntarily freeing the spot in his left, which was generally occupied by Daphne.
Daphne looked at the Prince of Slythrins, and immediately understood the reason for this move.
Mary-Ann Entwhistle was under Draco Malfoy's protection.
She would be untouchable, leaving her time to prover herself.

As Lary-Ann was introduced to the Slytherins while eating the delicious welcome feast, Augusta Longbottom was thoughtfull.
The coming year would be eventful.
Dumbledore was still gome, Crouch had been judged and imprisonned for freeing his son, Amelia was Interime Minister and probably the next Minister for Magic, and especially the even she would announce soon…

As the mean was ending and she could see all had eaten well, she stood up, demanding the students' attention.

"Welcome back everyone for this start of the year, and special welcome for our new students.
The previous year meant many changes to your education.
This year, they will be lesser, but your year will be quite animated.
Before all else, let me tell our first years as well as some older students and Mr. Gregori and Mr. Sawlings will regularly patrol with our Professors to ensure that you follow curfew, beit in the castle itself, or in the park."

Augusta gamve the twins a particularly menacing glance.
That they roamed for the Alliance was not that much of a problem.
But transforming them all into pink goats with green dots was out of the question.

"Furthermore, I announce that the Quidditch House Cup will not happen this year…"

Outraged screams rang out, but the daggers the Headmistress gave the room calmed them down rather quickly.

"As I was saying before being rudely interrupted, there will be no Quidditch Cup this year, because Hogwarts will host…"

At this moment, the doors to the Great Hall opened brutally, showing a strage and frightening character in the opening.
Vlamdir grumbled curses as he saw the electric blue eye and the wooden leg.

Noticing that the whole Great Hall was looking at him and the headmistress was furious at his entrace, the wizard made an effort to discreetly stay in a corner, even though Vladmir knew that the man was not the most discreet, except when it saved his life.
Although Augusta Longbottom's fury maybe could mean death…

"For the thirf consecutive time, no Quidditch, because Hogwarts will host an event that has not happened in more than a century, the Tri-Wizard Tournament!"

This time, the Headmistress let the jubilation happen, as she followed the newcomer with her eyes, as he was discreetly weaving in and out to the Professor table.
Vladmir held back a chuckle when he saw her sharply point to the last empty seat without responding to what seemed to be sincere excuses.
After a few minutes, Augusta asked for silence again.

"While a good number of you have heard about this Tournament, I think several of you you like an exaplanation.
It is a historic event happening every five years, which came out of the will to strengthen the links between the main three magic schools in Europe: Hogwarts, Beauxbâtons and Rochefroide, as well as Durmstrang."

"That's four, isn't it?" Someone next to Kevin asked, confused.

"Beauxbâtons and Rochefroide are one single school, but the first is a girls-only boarding school in somewhere in the centre of Paris, while the other is a boys-only boarding school lost int he Alps."

"Shush!" Lisa Turpin grumbled as the Headmistress was looking daggers at them for daring ‑ _again_ ‑ to interrupt her speech.

"Do you have something to add, Mister Entwhistle?" the Longbottom asked, falsely joyful.

"I was exaplining to my Housemate that Beauxbâtons and Rochefroide are a single school, boys and girls being separated, Headmistress."

Augusta accepted this explanation, useful for once, before continuing.

"This will materialized into a friendly competition.
Each school was represented by a champion and the winner was decided by three magical tasks.
This event ended after the death of two champions in 1872."

The silence that followed was nearly reveent, and Vlamdir wondered what this veiled warning would have been under Dumbledore.
It would probably be forgotten, not heard as the students would have talked in an lovely brouhaha…

"In order to reestablish the links between our schools, which also opened the door to large exchange student programmes, we have decided to restart this tradition with the help of the Department of International Magical Cooperation, the International Confederation of Wizards, and the Departement of Magical Games and Sports.
Foreign students will come in October and will share this year with us.
I hope you will all make the most of this exchange."

Vlamdir saw the Weasley twins talk enthousiastically, like most students, and he chuckled, knowing most would be severeley disillusionned.

"However," the Headmistress, making a careful silence fall back in the Great Hall," following the numerous deaths in the previous editions, only of age students will be allowed to participate.
Because of how dangerous the tasks are, students under the sixth and seventh years are unlikely to complete them.
No exception will be given, even with the agreement from your parents and guardians."

The Headmistress's gaze slowly went over all the students, ignoring no one, making them all feel like they were put under a mangifying glass.

"Finally, before dismissing you, Professor Lupin has resigned for familial reasons.
Alastor Moody will replace him," the Headmistress gestured towards the newcommer with a murderous gaze.
The latter stood up awkwardly, slightly pale, and greeted everyone one, before sitting back down in a hurry.

Only Vladmir knew the exact reasons why Lupin resigned.
Not only did he want to renew his friendship with Sirius, but under the insistance of his close circle, he had accepted to meet Jack Riper and spend several months learning to be a true werewolf and accept his nature.

<hr>

That same evening, as the curfew had started and the usual House meetings for the start of the year were done, the Alliance was still laughing at the former Auror's worry.
Calmly settled in their HQ, they had listened to André telling them while giggling about the harsh telling-off the wizard had gotten.
They had all gathered to discuss the new year, before each taking care of their own business.

While Vladmir, in the back of the HQ, was rumination what Kevin defined as yet another devious scheme against Dumbledore, Hermione was getting documentation about school exchanges, Kevin had disappeared to the Slytherins to see his sister, and Luna was sleeping on Draco's lap, while he was carefully reading about one of the twins' project.

Credic, who was sitting with Fred and George above the Alliance accounts, was smiling, the profits of the World Cup bets still in his mind.
All three were preparing the coming year of the Hogwarts Contraband.
The Tri-Wizard Tournament was a true boon for them, and the twins had just finished their inventory and had established a list for Vladmir and Neville to get stock before the Delegations arrived.

As he was completing his accounts, preparing the transfers to each member, Cedric looked at the huge tapestry representing the Allaince's and its members' symbols, perfect counterpart to the Marauder's Map in the room.

Cedric observed the tapestry and smiled.
A new animal had appeared, more precisely an insect…
A beautiful green and blue butterfly was shining around the shield of the small group.
Without any hesitation, he created a new page for his accounts, and instead of splitting their revenue in 9 ‑ since Fawkes and André had not bank account ‑ Cedric split everything into 10, including a certain Mary-Ann Entwhistle.
