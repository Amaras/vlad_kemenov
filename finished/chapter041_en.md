# Chapter 41: The return of the Five Families

"Second day out, as exhausting as the first," Draco sighed, letting himself fall into one of the Ravenclaw Common Room's comfortable chairs.
He ignored the offended looks from several occupants at the Slytherin's bottle, and comfortably across the arms, and frowned as he observed the ceiling of the Common Room.
A two-headed eagle?

A blonde head leaned over him above the backrest, and Draco got put in a prison of hair.

Slightly crossed-eye at seeing the upside-down face, he saw cheerful eyes, an impish nose, and two daisy earrings?

"May I?" Luna asked.

"Of course!"

"Nice!"

"No, not like… urgh…"

Drago snorted when the small blonde Ravenclaw settled down calmly on his lap, babbling with an invisible creature as usual.
He let his head fall back on the armrest and looked at the eagle engraved in the ceiling.

"They are coming."

"Who?" the Slytherin asked distractedly.

"The Princes and Kings of our World."

A smile lit up Draco's face, while Luna was radiant.

"You're cute, you two," Kevin teased, walking into the room, followed by the other Alliance members.
"Allow me to join you…"

Without waiting for an answer, he sat down over Draco and Luna.

"Don't forget me!" Hermione protested, settling down on Draco's lap.

"Oi!
You're heavy!" the Slytherin was huffing and puffing.

"Wait for meeee!"

"Neville, No!" Hermione yelled in laughter as the Gryffindor was jumping across everyone's lap.

"You alright, Draco?" Vlamdir asked mockingly, leaning over the scarlet blond head that sticked out from this pile of people.

"Tell… them… to… get… off!"

"I'm gonna think about it, Dray, but first…"

Vladmir ruffled his friend's perfectly neat hair, getting an offended yell.
At that moment, a bright flash surprised them, and they turned their heads towards Lisa, one of the Ravenclaw in Vladmir and Kevin's year.

"Sorry, but…
It's just too goo…" she laughed, giving them the magical photograph that she had just taken.

Neville, still slumped over the others, took the photo and laughed out loud, before passing it along.

On the animated picture, a furious Draco quite crushed under the mass was screaming on Vlamdir, who ruffled his hair with a sadistic smile.
Neville was boubled over laughing, tickled by Luna and Hermione, was Kevin was amused at the sight, while holding the Gryffindor's arms to prevent him from defending himself.

"That sums everything up quite nicely," Kevin laughed.

"That you're sadistic?" Neville said ironically.
"I already knew it and…
Nooo!"

BAM!

The lion fell on the soft rugs in the Ravenclaw Common Room, having been pushed by the Muggle-Born.
Laughter erupted from everywhere in the room as Neville aksed the spectators to bear witness of the Ravenclaw' sadism.
The small group of friend had become a must-see inthe Common Room.
Even if Draco was tolerated in the Lions' den, it was not true love, and the reverse‑Gryffindors in Slytherin… it was even more tense…

"I was going to ask what was creating so much unrest in my usually calm House…
I have my answer, however," the Charms Professor's reedy voice exclaimed, his completely black eyes shining with amusement.
"Invaders, go back to your respective Common Rooms!
I think you have to pack your studd for tomorrow morning."

"Yes, Sir!" Hermione smiled while standing up.

"Yes, Professor," Draco declared, managing to free himself.
He looked at his crumpled clothes and sniffled, miffed, before getting his wand out and ajusting his outfit.

"Do we have to?" Neville protested, still on the ground.

"You're free to stay in Hogwarts, Nev!"

"To miss the Siberian race?
Never!"

And the Longbottom hair jumped up, before running out, dragging Hermione behind him.

"Do you have a race during the holidays?" the small Goblin wondered.

"The Siberian charity race!" Vladmir raved.
"It's tomorrow!"

The Charms Professor gave him a smile.
He knew this Flightracing race's reputation.
It was the most famous in the world, because it gathered great racers, as well as all the Seekers from all the teams in the next Quidditch World Cup.
It thus happened every four years, slightly before Yule.
It was a tradition, and the profits from the tickets were donated to the rare magical mutual aid associations in the world.
Magical creature shelters, wizarding orphanages…

"I think it is the first time you run it, isn't it?"

Vlamdir had been far too young to run the previous one, but he had watched it, and it was what made him want to compete.

"Yes, Katya told me I was selected last week!"

As always, the particpants, all semi-professionals to be on roughly equal footing with the Quidditch players, were known at the last minute.
They were chosen randomly in a level class by the International Flightracing Federation.

Filius Flitwick could not hold back a discreet laugh, and wished him luck for the race.

<hr>

The next day, as the small group stepped down from the Hogwarts Express, they were surprised to be met by Katya and an impressive Irish wolfhoud.
He wanted to throw himself at Vlamdir, but the Kemenov matricarch caught him by the collar.

"Lie down, Padfoot!" the witch groaned.

The dog gave her a plaintive whimper and puppy eyes in response.
Vlamdir smiled as Kevin kneeled in front of the beast.

"Hi you," the Muggle-Born smiled, affectionately petting the silky head.
The wolfhound barked and put his front paws on Kevin's shoulders, making him laug.

"Hi Black," he whispered in his ear.
"I don't know if Vlad ever did the introductions.
I'm Kevin.
The blonde girl is Luna.
Among Gryffindors, there is Hermione  and Neville, and the Sytherin is Draco."

The Animagus barked again, before whimpering at Draco.
Apparently, it was still tense between the Blacks and the Malfoys.
He eventually licked the Ravenclaw's cheek, however.

"Are we going directly?" Neville asked with curiosity.

"Yes.
Augusta and Lucius are already waiting for us in Udachny."

"Will the race happend there?"

"It wil.
I hope you did not forget your winter clothes, it's near the polar circle," Katya warned them.
"Needless to say, it's not very warn this time of year."

All the Hogwarts students had indeed taken care to put on warm clothes and here wrapped up in warm capes.
Calmly, they walked towards the exit that directly connected to Diagon Alley.
For security reasons, since Sirius Black's evasion from Azkaban, it was impossible to Apparate or travel by Portkey directly to and from King's Cross Station.

"Isn't it always night in the polar circle this time of year," Hermione wondered.

"Let's say that there won't be any sun, but it will be bright enough to see," Vlamdir answered with a smile.

"Before we go, I have to give you this, Vlad.
It's your Christmas present, a bit early."

Katya had just stopped in a corner of Station Alley, and held out a packet with a characteristic shape, very long.

"A broom?" Vladmir was surprised.

"Your _Stea_ is getting old, and your last fall damaged it slightly.
I know you should not race with an unknown broom, but…
Your godfather and myself thought it would be best anyway."

"Blimey, open it, Vlad," Draco whispered, eyes staring at the wrapping paper.

"Yes, go on!" Neville encouraged him.

Kevin rolle his eyes, mumbling on Quidditch fanatics, as Vladmir teared the paper, ignoring the curious loks from many students around them who walked with their families.

Slowly, as silvery wood appeared, with slender and aerodynamic curves.
Vladmir was speechless, immeditaly recognising the small grey bolt, with an ice star at the end.

"What is that?" Draco asked, frowning
"It was not presented in the Wizarding Sports' issue about brooms…"

"It's because it's a British journal," Katya answered, amused.
"It is the best broom on the market internationally in the Flightracing category.
It's a …"

"Ice Bolt," Vladmir whispered, slowly caressing the wood.
"0 to 240 kph in 10 seconds, full speed turning radius of 2 metres…"

"It is a Flightracing model by Bolt & Co.
The high-end broom, the Fire Bolt, is better known in your side of the world."

"Fire Bolt?
Several Quidditch teams chose it as their official broom," Draco noted.
"It's the fastest broom in the world."

"Yeah, but the English chose to stay with Nimbus 2002s," Kevin declare, catching suspicious glances once more.
"What?
Just because I'm not interested in Quidditch doesn't mean I don't read the news."

"You Ravenclaw," Neville sniffled with a mocking smile.
"But it's logical that the English stayed with a good old Nimbus, the Nimbus Corporation is an English company.
Bolt & Co. is American."

"And the Comets?"

"Comet Enterprise is actually lithuanian.
They cover the European market with quality broom, while ramaining affordable," Katya explained.
"Most students have Comets for a reason.
They also have a few more specific brooms, produced by their romanian branch.
The _Steas_ are a good example."

"And Asia country, don't they have companies?"

"They do.
They also do excellent racing brroms, but they don't really export them much…"

"In any case, I would never have thought that broom companies would have developped a Flightracing line.
Then again, I did not know there were special models for Flightracers."

"They can also be used by Seekers.
If I remember correctl, the English team equiped their Seeker witha _Stea_," Katya said.

Vlamdir, who barely listened to the conversation, kneeled on the ground to hold the wolfhound against him.

"Thank you Sirius.
It's a wonderful gift," he whispered, before getting pushed to the ground by the dog.

Katya pestered while preventing the Animagus from joyfully licking her nephew's face.

"Enough, you mutt!'

And she roughly pulled him back, before declaring that the time for their International Portkey was near.

"Hold on," Katya declared, getting an old chipped plate.

As always, the transportation was nearly instantaneous and unpleasant.
They landed in a small panelled room, with warm colours.

"Portkey 959-RUR-91 from London, Station Alley, arrived at 12:30."

They quickly left the circle of security runes engraved in the ground to prevent stowaways from entering Russian territory, and they approached the receptionnist.

"Welcome to Russia," a bearded man declared with a thick accent, wearing he traditionnal ushanka.
"Names?"

"Katya Annapovna Kemenov, vlamdir Vassilievitch Hermione Granger, Kevin Entwhistle, Draco Malfoy, and Neville Longbottom."

**"Wel…
Welcome back to the Motherland, your Highnesses,"** the Russain said, bowing down low in front of the two russians as Katya finished the introductions.
**"And may Magia guard you, Tsesarevitch Vladmir."**

**"Thank you, officer."**

They quickly left the room, leaving the still bowing civil servant and immediately met Lucius, Severus, and Augusta who were waiting for them.

"The race is in less than three hours," Severus said as they stepped out the small government building in the Republic of Sakha.
"Will you have enough time to prepare?"

"I'll simply warm up a bit," Vladmir nodded.

"It's so beautiful!" Neville whispered, stopping at the vision in front of them.

"Welcome to the polar night," Katya laughed.

In front of them, the bare landscape was covered in snow, turning a crepuscular blue.
The sky was dark and stars dotted with stars.

"Excuse me?
I am looking for the Flightracing race will happen…"

The small group turned behind them to see a bunch of redheads, some of which were familiar to them.

"Ronald."

"Vlamdir."

"Weasley," Lucius coldly greeted.

"Malfoy," the Weasley patriarch answered in kind.

"So you came with your family?" Hermione asked, surprised.

"Yep," Fred answered.

"Hi guys," his twins added with a huge smile.

"Arthur Wealsey!" a smiling chubby woman exclaimed, her cheeks reddened by the cold.
"You are forgetting your manners.
We are not at the Ministry, Mr. Malfoy is not here to hassle you!
Nice to meed you, Ladies, I am Molly Wealsey, the mother to this little tribe."

The two Ladies looked at each other, amused by the mother's good-heartedness.

"Katya Annapovna Kemenov," Katya reintroduced herself.
""My nephew, Vladmir, and his freinds, Hermione Granger, Neville Longbottom, Kevin Entwhistle, and Draco Malfoy.
I think you already know Mrs. Longbottom and Mr. Malfoy?"

"Only by reputation," Molly Wealsey smiled softly.
"Let me introduce you to Arthurs, my husband, as well as my sons, William, Percival, Federeic and George, Ronald, and my youngest, Ginerva."

"Are you encouraging the English team's Seeker, children?" Arthur asked.

"Not really, Sir," Hermione smiled in response.
"Vlamdir is competing, we're gonne encourage him."

"So you are gonna meet my oldest," the Weasley pratiarch smiled proudly.
"He hid this hobby from me, the secretive little thing, but I am clad that he a passion apart from his dragons."

"It's still a dangerous sport," the mother worried, ignoring the exasperated lookds from Lords Malfoy and Prince at those details.

"I already know Charlie, Sir," the Russian boy said.
"Now, if you will excuse me, I need to go prepare!"

<hr>

This, two ours later, the rest of the Alliance, as well as the Weasley family, awkward at being in such illustrious company‑there were no less than Lord Prince, Lady Kemenov, Lady Longbottom, and especially, Lord Malfoy and his son‑and frustrated Lords‑Lord Malfoy, associated with the Weasleys?‑were on tom of the grandstands, with a drect view of the whole circuit.

"Blimey, it's…"

"Huge!" Fred and George exclaimed, the only ones with their brother William not to be uneasy with the others.

Indeed, while the previous races were very watches, the stands here were just… humongous.
They were placed in semi-circles around a huge crater, and they were full of thousands of wizards and witches from the whole world.

"Look Mum, it's Avery Hawksworth!" Ginny screamed suddenly.

"The captain and Chaster of the Lawland Roses and the English team.
You see those stands there?" pointing to the two large stands slight apart from the others and decorated with multicoloured flgs, those of the countries were placed next to the Flightracers' banners.

"Yes."

"There are the six players and their three substitutes."

"Are they pushed away so that they are not harrassed?" Hermione guessed.

"Why six?" Percy Weasley wondered, listening to the conversation, before adding condescendingly.
"Quidditch teams have seven members."

"The seventh is a racer…"

"… dumbass," George added with a contemptuous sniffle.

"Frederic Gideon Weasley, Goerge Fabian Weasley!" their mother screamed, while Arthur Weasley simply smiled slightly, William smiling aprovingly.

"Blimey, it's so good," Fred whispered to Kevin.
"Generally, he's the one looking down on us…

"Hey guys!"

"Cedric!
What are you doing here?" George suddenly yelled, seeing the Hufflepuff elbowing his way through the crowd to join them, dragging a balding middle-size man behind him.

"Come here, brother!" Fred yelled in turn.

And Cedric had a school mate as tall as him in his arms, while the man, middle-aged, gave the adults a forced smile.

"Mr. Diggory," Arthur Weasley greeted him.

"The man had a rictus that he wanted to be warm and responded to all.
But it was obvious that he was looking at his son from the corner of his eyes, who was in an agitated conversation with the twins.
He did not seem thrilled to see the strong bond between Cedric and the two Wealsey prankers.

"Amos, allow me to introduce you to my partner, Katya Kemenov-Potter."

Severus people tried to hold back a smile as she elbowed Lord Malfoy's ribs discreetly at the mention of her full name.
It was rare that she put her name in the spotlight, despite her incredible resemblance wiht James Potter;
And Lucius knew exactly what he was doing, be cause Amos Diggory's face became amicable and had a most hypocritical smile, focusing on the Kemenov Matriarch.

"Madam, it is an honour to meet such a charming young lady," the man declared with honeyed words, galantly kissing her hand, while his son made a face, embarassed by his attitude.

After a few words, Amos Diggory insisted on getting his son away from all those people as quickly as possible, caiming they had to go back to their seats.

Before they could examine Cerdic's father's strange bahaviour further, a man levitated in front of the now filled up stands.
THe spaces were lit up by hundreds of enchanted paper lanters, but the site of the race was still undetermined because of the polar night.

"Ladies and Gentlemen!
Welcome to this 422nd Flightracing charity race!
Today, we have eighteen international Seekers, and twelve flightracers.
Need I introduce them?"

Crazed screams rose up from the crowd when the eighteen Seekers from the World Cup national teams appeared on a huge stage, followed by the twelve selected flightraces.

They were all wearing protections, and the Seekers were slightly clumnsy because of all the layers they were not used to wearing.

"Wow it's…"

"Huge!" Hermione whispered, as the beginning of the course was light up.
The stands were in semi-circuls around a gigantic open-pit mine.
The Udachnaya pipe pit, nearly a kilometre across, was one of the first mines officially managed by Muggles, but in reality belonged to Goblins.
The crater was in full operation, and was more than 600 metres deep.

However, the most surprising things were the large trucks driving down the spiral path, their powerful headlights piercing the polar night.

"But… don't they see us?" Ginny asked, pressing against her mother, aparently uneasy at the impressive opening.

"Large scale invisibility charms," the Weasley patriarch declared.
"Look!
Charlie is there!"

"And Vlamdir is three rows behind him!" Fred added.

Vlamdir, who was entering alongside a freezing Congolese Flightracer, deeply brreathed in the glacial air, and smiled softly when he lokked down on his brand new Ice Bolt.

The crowd was screaming, waiting for the names of the pariticiapnts.
The host obliged joyfully, and at each new name, part of the crowd encouraged the participant from their Quidditch team.

"And now that you know all the Seekers, let me introduce to you our Flightracing prodigies!
They all are semi-professional, but you'll need to be careful of them, gentlemen.
Starting from…
The British and Romanian by adoption, Charlie Weasley!
He's a rocket on his _Stea_, and he won the Romanian championship twice!"

The Wealsey participant smiled when the giant screens focused on him.

"We also have the brilliant Dona Alvarez, who feats cannot be understated!"

The introductions continued, quick, until…

"And finally, the youngest of the race, the young Vlamdir Kemenov, who will fly on the brand new Fire Bolt!
Don't judge him fron his age, he finished just fourth during the last Russian Championship race!
And now… Let's start the race!
Flightracers, take place!"

The Seekers and flightracers took off at the same time and placed themselves on the starting line, and the usual spell signalled the start of the race.

"They are fast," Fred noted, as the thirty racers sped up.
The new Fire Bolts immediately made the difference, and the dozen or so Sekkers and Vlamdir took the lead.
They went straight ahead, flying over the huge crater, and suddenly, the first arrow appeared… pointing straight down towards the flooded pit of the mine.

The eleven racers dived together, quickly followed by the others.
The nosedive was quick.
At nearly 200 kph, 600 metres was not much…
Not receiving a stop or direction change signal was something else…

When they arrived at 50 metres from the surface of the water, which was as hard as diamond at that speed, most Seekers slowed down, the crowed booing them, leaving Vladmir, followed by a few flightracers, leading the race.

A few seconds from impact, a large whirlpool appeared a metre away.
Vlamdir turned at the last moment, but he had the time to hear other racers fall, as well as the screams from the crowd.

He went into th the strange water tunnel, which lead into an underground gallery.
Weaving through the rocks, he saw a spark of light in the distance, and sped up.
And it was a bad move…

Many people booed when they saw that the end of the tunnel was suddenly blocked by one of the monstruous mining trucks, the source of the light.

Indeed, while the race was happening, the Muggles, under the effects of powerful Confundus Charm, did not realize the wizards and witches were there… and thus continued to work.

"Well, the young Kemenov narrowly missed a brutal encounter with the Muggle trucks!"

Vlamdir, forced to land, lost several places.
Swearing, he took off again, and quickly went back to the front, using all the power of his Ice Bolt.

After leaving the tunnels, the race continued along the impressive exploitation path that spiraled up towards the exit.
The only dangers there were the mining machinery, true monsters which, paired with the track's limits, had caused two Seekers to be eliminated, as they were not used to how narrow the track was.

Once they reached the surface, the arrows guided them towards Udachny, a small mining town.
The flightracers, protected by the spells, flew through part of the down, before discovering the jys of huge buildings.
They went through coridors, and even a few homes, and they had to be really careful to avoid Muggles, walls, swing doors…"

"This year's reace is truly nasty," Lucius sniggered, observing he constant spins the racers had to do.

"It's dangerous," Hermione was slightly panicked.
"If they collide with a Muggle, and…"

Screams rose up in the race, a mix of fear and laughter.
A Slavic Seeker had just stolen a pram which suddenly appeared from him.
He thus had a baby in his arms, and was forced to go back and give the little one back.

"But…"

"All the race has specific enchantments.
The Muggles are all protected with very powerful shidling spells.
Even a building collapsing on them would not harm them," Katya explained.
"It required a huge amount of work from the organizers.

"Where is Vlad?" Kevin suddenly asked.

"There!" Draco exclaimed, pointing to a forest.
"And he managed to find the shortcut!"

"Oh!" the commentator exclaimed.
"The young Kemenov was the only one to see the shortcut in the forrest!
After his time oss in the tunnels, he manages to get back to the leading pack!
So we have Krum, Wzanzi, Asawilaya, Weasley, Kemenov, and Lian-Tu battling for first place!" the man screamed as they went through the first lap finish line.
"Parkin, Smith, Flemings, Arikawa and Ramirez are closely behing them!"

The other competitors were in groups of two or three, not trying to go on the podium, as it was already too late after the first lap, they mostly wanted to finish the race."

"Let me remind you that we already have three withdrawls!
I have just received the information that Wu-zu is okay, and will be able to represente China during the World Cup matches!"

Relieved whisperes could be heard from the stands.
Most of the spectators were worried after they had seen the Seeker from the Magical Republic of China's Seeker violently hit the surface of the mine's lake.

"Look at Vlad!" Kevin suddenly yelled.

The young Flightracer had paired up with Charlie Weasley, making an efficient, although quite unorthodox duo.

"That's…'

"… our older brother!" Fred and George said enuthiastically, watching the readhead's manoeuvre to slow donw an opponnent, while Vlamdir, with the power of his broom, created a draft to help Charlie stay in his wake.
One opened the way, the other covered their backs.

"Wealsey and Kemenov slowly but surely are taking the lease!" the comentator screamed.
"How much time will it last?
Our youngest competitor is efficent, but maintaining that speed is exhausting!
And too bad for our Transylvanian Seeker, he could not avoid Weasley's trap!"

Whispers could be heard among the wizards and witches in the stands when they realized that Charlie, drafted along by Vlamdir, could focus less on the race… and thus cast spells…
His illusion had been enough to bring the first behind them to a mistake.

Their duo worked well, the two wizards managed to keep the lead until the last straight.

"Will Kemenov be fair-play?" the commentator yelled.
"Yes he will!
He is waiting until our Romanian champion is at his level…
What a speed up my friends!
Kemenov keeps a slight lead thanks to his broom and light weight, but Weasley's aerodynamics are better.
He is not allowing Kemenov to get away and is even getting closer centimetre by centimetre…
They are shoulder to shoulder!
Less than one kilemetre away!
They are not letting each other pass, and oh, no, Mister Weasley!
But he is taking the race lead with less than metre…
Kemenov is exhausted by having opening the way during the whole second lap, and he can't catch up, and…
WEASLEY WINS THE RACE!
Kemenov is second place, followed by Parkin!"

Charlie stopped next to the commentator and accepted the friendly slap on his back by the young Russian, while Parkin, the third of the race, joined them.
All three made a synchronised loop in the air for the frenzied crowd, before going to the stands.
The young Seeker from the Lawland Roses flew to his teammates and was lifted up under their cheers.
Charlie Weasley landed in his twin brothers' arms, while Molly Wealsey, visibly shocked, was sobbing on her husband's shoulder.

Hermione, pragmatic, took a dozen photographs of the Russian, first flying towards them, then getting crushed in a bear hug from his aunt, before getting drowned in hugs from Draco and Neville, then the twis.

Because it was the very first time the young Russian was ever on the podium of a race…

Quickly, the winners left them to go back to the host, where the three winners got their symbolic medal.
While the crowd was pressing all around the stands, the Allaince managed to get to their friends, with Cedric in tow, who managed to leave his father in the crowd.

Vlamdir was talking with several people, who happened to be the players of the Enlgish team and their coach, who was a legend in Brittish Quidditch.

"… are in Hogwarts?" Blythe Parkin asked, who was revealed to be a smiling and thin man without the Flightracing protections, and who played as a Seeker.

"Hey Vlad, you have quite the compagny here," Fred smiled, passing a hand around the Russian's shoulders.

"I nearly am jealous," his twin added, winking at the only woman in the English team.

"What I don't understand, she said," is why a Russian is enrolled in Hogwarts.

"Didn't have much of a choice," Vlamdir grumbled.
"But I don't have any regret," he added, smiling brightly at his friends.

"Do you play Quidditch?" the English captain asked.

"Nor really," VLamdir laughed.

"I do!" Fred exclaimed.

"So do I," Georged added, amused.

"Let me guess… Beaters?" the oldest wizard asked, his face wrinkled, but his body still fit.

"Exactly!" they both answered in unison.

"And we also have two Seekers!" Neville declaired, putting his arm around Draco's neck while ruffling his hair.

"From two different Houses?" a man wondered, frowning.

"Do you have a problem with inter-Houses friendships?" Cedric asked coldly, standing taller.

Admittedly, the sixteen-year-old Hufflepuff could be impressive when he stood at hull height and he looked threatening.
The eight reprensentatives of English Quidditch looked at each other, uneasy at the suddenly sombre faces from the group of eight teenagers.
Their friendship was a sensitive subject…

"Not at all," the young Beater intervened, looking daggers at the man who had just talked.
"It's jsut… surprising."

"I hope so.
I am Cedric Diggory, and I play for Hufflepuff," Cedric declared.
"My best opponent, Draco Malofy, is the Slytherin Seeker.
As for Fred and George, they are no less than the best Beaters Gryffindor have known… for a long time."

"It's good to see friendship between the Houses," a Chaster tempered.
"Mutual aid values have long been forgotte…
I don't know if you remember me, Cedric, I was your friend Felix McBells's tutor."

"The completely ravaged seventh year who preferred to chase girls rather than work?" Cedric remembered with a frown, making the other laugh awkwardly and look sheepishly at Cedric in respose.

"I was a turbulent student indeed."

They continued to calmly talk, and slowly, the night thickened.
Katya appeared behinf the students and Quidditch players, unsurprisingly accompanied by Lucius, Augusta, and Severus.

"It is time to go home.
Well, what do we have here?
Good evening Leonard…"

"Lady Kemenov," the Lawland Roses became quite paled at seeing her, while Lucius disappeared discreetly.
Leonared did not see that, too busy staring at Katya in fear.

"I hope you are doing well," the young woman smiled, a smiled that the Alliance members had learned to dread.
The one that sent shivers down their spines, provoked a sudden goosebumps, and churned their stomachs in the worst way.
The imminent carnage one…

And apparently, Leonard had understood that he was in danger.

"What can I do for you, dear?"

"I thought you were _persona non grata_ in international Quidditch, my dear Fields."

"I…"

"You probably are mistaken, Madam," a Chaser timidly intervened.
"Leo is called Sanfleid."

"Leonard Fields, Leo Sanfleid…
A simple anagram?
I am disapointed Leonard, you were more creative back in the day, especially for cheating bets.
I think you planned to make the English lose to… maybe the Transylvanians…
The difference in level is quite large, and defeat is theoretically impossible."

This time, the man was so pale he was almost transparent.
The Lawland players, wary, had stepped away from their coach, who apparently was not unanimously accepted by his own players.
He thus was in the line of sight of the witch, who was standing ready to take out her wand.

"Excuse me, who do you think…" the Lawland Roses' Keeper, a tall, well-built blond man, dared to intervene.

"I think I am the former Auror in Chief of Russia," Katya explained coldly.
"And I have arrested Leonard Fields ten years ago."

**"The Russian Aurors?"** Kevin whispered, so that only Vladmir could understand him.

**"How do you think she knows three quarters of the civil servants of the Ministry?"** the Russian whispered back.
**"Now, she is the Speaker of the House of Nobles, but she was previously the Head of the Aurors."**

**"That takes the biscuit!"** Kevin whispered.

**"She had access to all the confidential information.
It was quite practical.
They never realised that some data was leaking,"** Vlad sniggered.

At that moment, three men arrived, following Lord Malfoy.
Field tried a tactical retreat, only to be blocked by his players.

"Did you really plan to make us lose?" Hawksworth, the team captain, asked with a blank face.

"I… No… You…
This woman is a manipulatrix!"

The punch that the Chaser gave him was impressive, and Fields, despite his usual balance, stumbled back.
He was caught by some one and was about to thank them, when he saw two grey eyes.

"Dear?"

"Please do, Lucius," Katya smiled, calmly crossing her arms, while the Lords dragged Fields to the ground with a sharp jolt.
The Russian Aurors stood ready to intervene.

"Now, you pathetic little worm, you need to learn that you insulted not only the Kemenov matriarch, but also the Potter matriarch, as well as my partner, thus…"

Lucius hit him sharply, and Fields's nose broke with a spatter of blood.

"He is all yours," the Lord smiled, pushing the moaning man towards the three Aurors.

"Thank you.
Leonard Fields, you are under arrest for identity fraud, and illegal practice of coaching," the squad leader declared.

The man's fleeing attempts, followed by a small band of amused Hogwarts students, shocked the Lawland Roses members, and made their paretns laugh, then they went to finish the evening in the huge Kemenov Palace.

The next day, the teenagers were allowed to skate on the Neva, and Vlamdir left them for a few hours to go to a London bar and contact some one in particular.

Katya, with the Underground's Triad, had decided to involve Vladmir in Albus Dumbledore's hunt.
He was thus, on this December 24 morning, in front of a bar, wearing jeans, old Converses soaked by the snow and a thick woollen coat that he had pushed the collar high to keep warm.
An old leather satchel was dangling against his waist when he entered the Ohara's Pub.

Vladmir, approaching the counter, observed the man calmly waiting with his elbows on the counter.
He only knew the name of the man he wanted to meet that morning.
The infamous Keller…
The best tracker in the _Underground_.
He suspected the reasons why Katya and the English Traid had sent him and not one of their usual intermediaries.
They wanted him to know when things went forward, and when they did not, so that he did not try himself to hunt one of the most tracked men, with the highest bounties in the world on his head.

The man was totally normal.
Neither tall, nor short, eyes between green and hazel, auburn hair…
Only his defined muscles, quite rare in the wizarding world, stood out.
A musculature that, according to Severus, was very efficient.

Vlamdir walked forward and got his jacket off before sitting down next to him.
He got a notebook and a textbook on World War Two out, which he started to study, while waiting for the bartender.

"Hi son!
What can I get for you?"

"I'll have a cola, please," Vladmir ordered while rolling up his jumper's sleeves, showing his Russian Court tatoo.

"Nice tatoo," Keller smiled, sipping on his whisky.

"Thanks, a gift from my aunt?" Vlamdir smiled in response.

"Familial initiation?"

The reference to the Master lines was obvious for the two members of the Mirage Court.

"Something like that.
Thank you," Vlamdir said when the bartender put down a cola in front of him.
He took out some change from his satchel and payed.

"You are not from here, are you?" the barman noted.

"Not really, but I study nearby," Vlamdir answeared with a lagh.
He tended to forget that his Slavic accent was so thick, and his frends were used to hearing it.

"Russia?" Keller asked calmly, although the tattoo had already given his the information on the youngster's Court.

Keller quickly connected the dots in his mind.
Between the rumours and what he had in front of his eyes, it was not hard to distinguish truthes and lies.

The rumours of the _Underground_ told about a huge help of the _Semirro_ in the renewal of the English Court.
To see this young man next to him, bearing the mark of the Russian Court on his arm only confirmed that rumour.
And this young boy was not unfamiliar.
This face and this scar were known in the whole English wizarding world.
Harry Potter, or rather Vlamdir Kemenov, student in Hogwarts, was in reality member of the Mirage Court.
And a Prince, judging from the crown over the symbol, nothing less than a future Court leader.

He also noted the innuendo, and it echoed another rumour.
According to the whispers, a small cell was operating right in Hogwarts.
And judging from who was in there, it was not surprising, after all…
The future was ensured.

"How much do you know about World War Two?" the Russian eventually asked, grimacing.

Keller smiled and sipped again on his whiskey, observing the young Russian.
For a boy raised in the magical world, he knew how to disappear into the Muggle crowd.
He even glanced at a walkman in his jacket's pocket.
He wondered where he could have hidden his wand, however…

"Some little things about Hitler and his friend, Gellert…" the tracker sighed.
"But it's an old story, and the data on the latter are thin."

"And about Gellert's sphere of influence?"

"Nothing.
His main support did not reappear.
However, according to stories in the financial circles, some of his properties raised suspicions.
They must be searched by the Security agents."

The financial circles…
Goblins had thus declared that three of the Dumbledore family's properties had to be searched, because they were still under Fidelius.
They thus had put three teams of spell breakers on the cae.
The links betwwen the Mirage Courts and the Goblin Nation were very strong, and it was obvious that Vladmir, as Friend of the Goblin Nation, also had privieges.
And most of the Golbins in his own sphere of influence know he wanted revenge.

"As soon as you know more, inform the Triad."

Keller nodded.
Dumbledore must have dome something truly bad to have such a high bounty on his head, as well as two whole Courts on his back.
Betwwent the ten thousand Galleons, Russia and Britain, the man surely was in a bad position…

"Any news from the rats who deserted the sinking ship?" the Russian eventually asked, bringing Keller back to reality.
He frowned, looking for connections between a rat and the current affairs and suddenly understood.
Peter Pettigrew…
Even him, if he found the Animagus, would give him a special treatme.
Keller had been a Gryffindor, the House of the brave.
And betrayal was, in his mind, the worst cowardice.

"No," he admitted.
"He did not reappear."

As he sipped on his glass again, the Tracker saw a flick of the Russian's wrist, so fluid and quick that he thought he had dreamt it.
Until he noticed the bartender's glazed eyes.

"He was listening a bit too closely," Vlamdir explained briefly with a smile, before flicking his wrist again.
Keller saw a glimpse of wood, and the bartender went to the tables on the other side.

"Interesting things?"

Keller smiled, adn took out a dossier from his pocker which he pushed towards the Russian.
The latter barely looked at it and made the thick enveloppe under his history book.

"That's it," the Tracker concluded.

"Perfect.
Have a good day…"

"Have a good day too, kid", the Tracker finally declared, gulping down the rest of his whisky.

Vlamdir nodded and smiled, brushing the thick dossier while Keller left the bar.
He barely had time to see the Mirage Court's seal.
After all, he could had interesting data in that pile of documents.
But for now, he had to go home quickly.
He was invited to a party, and had to attend…

Indeed, the Five Families had decided to appear at the Saturnalia Ball.

<hr>

The ball was happening at the Longbottom's.
It had been years since the venerable matriarch had retired from the polite society life and had thus not organised a ball.
Ever sunce her son and his spouse were sectionned in St Mungo, in fact.

However, something new happened when she agreed to become the new Hogwarts Headmistress.
Some had gossiped about it, thinking her as to old or too far form the wizarding world to be competent.
She had methodically destroyed all this gossip through her excellent management and improving results.
And to establish her position, she had used her network to organize the ball at her home.

Vlamdir smiled when he looked at the ballroom.
They were all on top of the honour stairs of the Longbottom manor, and slowly, conversations died down, as the whole of the wizarding high society realized they were there.

Theodore Nott Sr. was standing up straight and proud, despite his status as a Death Eater, a hand on his Heir's shoulder.
And he had galantly linked his arms with none other than the Head of the Department of Magical Law Enforcement, Amelia Bones, whose niece, Susan, was accompanied by her ex-fiancé, the young Lord Potter.
At his sides, the young Kevin Entwhistle, wearing robes showcasing the impressive Knight-Mage tatoo, was calmly talking with the Potter matriarch and Severus Prince, while Damocles Rowle and his wife were carefully listening to the young boy's words.

It was a scene no one thought they would witness in their lifetime.
Slowly, Lady Longbottom, her arms linked with Lord Malfoy's, and their respective heirs behind them, joined the Five Families, and the links between them were more than obvious.

Above all, seeing the young girl with huge hazel eyes and powerfull aura accompagnying Draco Malfoy, as well as the Knight-Mage tattop on the elegant boy's with unsettling blue eyes was making Pure-Bloods whisper.
Hermione Granger and Kevin Entwhistle, Muggle-Borns, common-or-garden Mudbloods, dared show themselves standing with the Five Families.

Things were moving in the wizarding world, and only idiot were not seeing the powerful political coalition forming in front of their eyes.
