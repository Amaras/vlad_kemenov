# Chapter 52: facing your fears

Vlad was still not out of the Hospital Wing, and he was starting to get bored, after only a day.
He hated to stay immobile and did nothing of his days, his nights were short.
At three in the morning, he was thus perfectly awake and alert, ruminating against Pomfrey's alarm spells that prevented him from even leaving his bed.
The Matron had ended up putting them on after she had caught him three times right before he got to the door.

To spend the time, at three in the morning, Vladmir was thus reading several journals narrating both the Tri-Wizard Tournament and the Clan War, sniggering at the points of view.
While the Russian ones, especially the _Red Dawn_, were offended that a clan's matriarch and famous politician woudl be arrested for her participation in one of the oldest traditions in their society, the British ones were horrified that a woman could get away with murdering someone in the middle of Hogwarts.
The diplomatic relationships between the two countries were thus quite tense, and from what he understood, the Ministry for Magic, especially Lucius Malfoy as Minister and Damocles Rowle as Head of International Cooperation, were ripping their hair out.

**"Auntie, your future husband will end up bald before you get your hands on him,"** Vladmir chuckled, looking at the photo of a particularly exasperated Minister for Magic on the front page of the _Daily Prophet_.

**"You're talking to yourself now, Kitten?"**

**"Knock before you enter, Sergei,"** the young Russian answered without looking up.

Sergei had spent all day with him until recently.
He had to feed after he had fasted for the three days he spent at his ward's bedside, and he had thus slipped away to the Forbidden Forest.

**"How are you?"** Sergei asked carefully.

**"Fine."**

**"Vladmir Vassilievitch, don't try that with me,"** the vampire sighed while sitting on his bed.

**"Tired."**

Sergei understood.
The tiredness whis ward was struggling with was not physical, but mental.

**"You're a bit yong for that."**

**"The Horcrux in my head.
The Five Families.
The Clan wards.
And now Draco.
The Tri-Wizard Tournament.
Hermione and her memoires…"**

**"You are afraid.
For yourself and the others,"** Sergei explained softly.
**"It's normal, Vladmir."**

**"It's too much,"** Vladmir whined softly, wrapping his arms around his knees.

Sergei sighed and softly embraced the young man, putting his head over Vladmir's head.
In response, he put his arms around the vampire's waist and nestled against him.

They stayed silent for a long moment, then Vladmir started to talk softly.
So softly that Sergei, despite his supernatural hearing, had to prick up his ears.

**"Katya will marry Lucius at some point.
But… where will she live?
How could she take care of the clan if she lives in Britain?
He is Minister for Magic and…
I am so happy for her but…
I don't want her to go.
She is my only family Sergei…"** Vladmir sniffed.

The vmapire sighed, be stayed silent for a few more seconds, starting to carefully pet his ward's hair.

**"And who am I exactly?
A Potter, with the associated charges?
Serverus… Severus will be king…
I promoised my self, and the prophecies…
But he can't do it alone…
And the Five Fmailies, we will do everything to help him, reestablish the monarchy.
The British need to.
They need a monarch… but so many obstacles!
The old piece of shit and his friend, the Pure-Bloods…
Avalon to find…
And if being a Potter wasn't enough, I am a Kemenov…
I don't was the title of Tsesarevitch and I…
I cannot inherit from both the Potters and the Kemenovs…
It's impossible, even if Kevin can take care of the Potter assest with his Knight-Mage status, there still are the political charges…
And Hermione, she is a Licorine… so risky for her… she will need Draco and everyone's support when they other will learn about it…
And Neville… your grandson…
Why is it so complicated?
This fucking parasite…
Grigori will help me, but he doesn't know how to do it and…
I must kill the ectoplasm as well…
Everything because of another fucking prophecy…
I have killed enough for a lifetime…
Even if Voldy deserves it… she didn't deserve it… her eyes… Anna…"**

Sergei calmly listen to Vladmir's disorganized speech.
What he was talking about was not new to him.
He was carefully looking at the events in the young Kemenov heir's life, and often discussed the repercussion onf the young man's mental health with Katya.
Vladmir, sniffing into the vampire's shirt, finally fell asleep.

The vampire was busy livingly tucking him in when the door of the Hospital Wing opened.

Sergei looked daggers at the new arrival and put a hand on his lips.

"He's just fallen asleep," he whispered to Kevin.

The Ravenclaw nodded and sat down next to Sergei.

"Why are you here?" the vampire whispered, noticing the school robes quickly pulled over his pyjamas, his hair ruffled.
It was past four in the morning, but Vlad's friend's gaze was alter.

"I don't know," kevin replied honestly, distractedly rubbing his arm.
"I felt something was wring, and woke up with the feeling that I had to be here."

"Is that the arm with your tattoo?" Sergei asked.
"May I?"

Kevin nodded and let the vmapire carefuly look at the impressive tattoo that nearly fully covered his arm.
He was surprised at the level of detail on the Potter coat-of-arms on the Muggle-Born's skin.
Sergei took his time and eventually smiled.

"The links between a lord and his vassal aren't well known because they are pretty rare nowadays.
I think that the vassalage oath, combined with your friendship, made you not only the Knight-Mage of the Potters, but also their liegeman.
It is a title given to the right-hand man of a wizarding lord or lady and which used an old form of magic, even older than the one used by the vassalage oathes.

"So, as liegeman, I would have instinctively felt that something was wrong?" Kevin mumbled.

"Exactly."

"He's thinking about too much," the Ravenclaw sighed.
"I think that the clan war was the straw that broke the camel's back."

"Muggle saying?" Sergei asked with a small smile, even if what Kevin had just said worried him.

"Yes."

"He spilled all he had on his mind," the vampire admitted.

"You should talk about it with Katya," Kevin declared softly.
"I think he is terrified of being sidelined."

"Pardon?"

"He has nightmares," the Ravenclaw sighed.
"I think he feels excluded, and not really a Kemenov.
It is getting very serious between Katya and Lucius, he only sees her during the holidays…
He is worried about the moment when their relationship becomes official."

"What is this bullshit?" Sergei took offence.

Vladmir mumbled something in his sleep in response to Sergei's sudden yell.

"First… his blood links with the Kemenovs come from a blood adoption, he already feels partially excluded.
Second, if Katya has a son, or even adaughter, he loses any right to the succession.
Maybe, if she has a daughter, he will keep the Tsesarevitch title for machistic reasons, but in any case, he wouldn't be _Heretem_ Kemenov any more."

"But… he never wanted the title," Sergei was horrified.

"Maybe, but it is a tangible link with the Kemenovs," the Ravenclaw sighed.

"I… it's absurd," Sergei whispered.
"He never showed any fear or…"

"I think it's the whole thing, Sergei," Kevin explained.
"Too much at once…
He needs support from his family and… I think the hardest thing, even if it is not a conscious decision, is that every time he sees you or Katya, it's for clann matters, and not to spend time with him…"

"And in the office, with Draco…" Sergei was horrified once more.

"Draco became Katya's priority over himself.
Unconsciously, he felt rejected.
Add to that the Tri-Wizard Tournament, three dangerous wizards wanting him dead, the knowledge of having a mental parasite and a clan war that broke his mind, and you get uncertainy and irrational fears."

"Katya watched over him…"

"He was in a coma, Sergei.
From his point of view, Katya was not there, and when he woke up, she was in prison.
And you, you over whom he relies over all else, you who watched over him as Augusta poisoned him, you are going to have a family with your grandaughter and her family.
The Longbottom are your real family, and Vlad feels like he is slowly eing abandonned."

Sergei looked at Kevin without saying a word, then turned towards Vladmir.
The Russian teenager was sleeping, be he could see his eyes move underneath his eyelids, showing he was dreaming.

"Who can you…?"

"I went through it as well.
It was different and the same.
When I started to use accidental magic, my world collapsed.
My parents started to spend more time with their other children.
My brothers played less with me.
They words became colder, exclusively about school marks, chores…
Then I had a little brother and a little sister…
The fact that Mary-Ann used accidental magic since birth was the only thing that saved me."

"Otherwise…"

"I don't know," Kevin admitted.
"Maybe I would have run away…
Maybe I would have done something worse, and…"

Kevin fell silent at the sudden hug from Sergei.
The vampire sighed when, enventaully, the Ravenclaw relaxed.

"It is the first time in a long while that I am held that way," Kevin mumbled.

"You are idiots, both of you," Sergei whispered.
"But you understand him better than I ever could."

"Sergei…" Kevin whispered.

"Hmm?"

"Can I stay like that a little bit more?" he mumbled?

Sergei's chest shaking showed Kevin that he was laughing, but he also felts that that the arms around his shoulders were tightening slightly.

**"Sleep, little kitten, I'm watching over you both."**

At Sergei's appeasing whisper, Kevin soon joined Vladmir in slepp.
He cas quickly laid down next to his best friend, and at dawn, the Matron found them both sleeping in the same bed.

"What is Mister Entwhistle doing here?" she asked out loud.

Sergei motioned for her to be silent, and Madam Pomfrey sighed as she cast a silencing spell around the Gemini's bed befored turned to her ofice to prepare a cup of tea, feeling that something was wrong.

"Explain!" she barked as she put a cup of tea in Sergei's hands.

"It's… complicated…" Sergei grumbled.

"Elaborate."

Sergei sniggered at the authoritarian orders of the old whitch, but obeyed.

"Vladmir curently had many things to process about family… he worried about his place in the family."

"Fear of abandonment?" the Hogwarts Mediwitch asked, voice full of worry.
"He confessed to you."

"Yes to both.
How, by Mother Magia, do you know that…?"

"It is not so rare, but it is surprising to see it happen now.
There must be a significative change in Mister Kemenov's familial life for this to happen."

"His aunt is in a relationship with Lord Malfoy."

"Ah… a new potential authority figure appears, the sharing of his maternal figure with Mister Draco Malfoy, and the decrease of the attention the Kemenov matriarch gives him," the Matron listed.
"It is quite usual to see among children of blended families, although they are quite rare in the wizarding world, and this fear of abandonment usually only happens in younger children."

"So many factors can trigger this anxiety?" Sergei was horrified.

"There are many factors, Mister Pokhastovine.
Usually, the axiety does not come from traumatising events, just an accumulation of factors.
In Mister Kemenov's case, from what I know, it can be many things."

"Could you explain?" Sergei asked calmly.

"Well, Lady Kemenov is a busy woman.
If I understood correctly, after being an Auror, she now has an important position in the Russian Ministry.
Without mentioning managing a large clan…"

Sergei mentally added her role in the _Semirov_ and understood, even before Madam Pomfrey continued, the first possible factor.

"Lady Kemenov is probably overbooked.
I can assume that young Vladmir was more often watched over by a nanny than by his aunt."

"Yes… as well as by the clan.
But they took care of him and…"

"Mister Pohkastovine.
In the mind of a five-year-old, or even a ten-year-old, the fact that his mother figure was not regularly there can have a major psychological impact," the Matron sighed.
"The love and attention his other guardians don't matter as much, since it was not from his aunt.
I don't even want to talk about the lact of a father figure… even if I think you are the closet thing to it in his life, which could explain why he confided in you first."

"Other triggers?" Sergei worried.

"Oh yeah," the old witch sighed, putting a few drop of a calming potion in Sergei's cup.
The vampire did not object and drank the liquid down in one.

"Being put in a boarding school."

"Pardon?
Boarding school?
But…"

"What do you think Hogwarts is, Mister Pokhastovine, except a boarding school for everyone?
Lady Kemenov sent her nephew in a school nearly 2000 kilometres from where he lives, with the full knowledge that they would only see each other three months a year for several years.
American studies have compared the state of mind of Salem students, a wizarding school with day pupil system, with a boarding school in Philadelphia, like Hogwarts is.
The Philadelphia students have a lower moral and get lower marks.
Some even feel rejected by their familes for being sent there rather than another school."

"Katya wanted Vlad to g oto Hogwarts, like his parents before him… while he wanted to study at Durmstrang…" sergei stuttered.

"… which allows students to go back home every weeked," Madam Pomfrey added.

Sergei almost felt bad.
It was so obvious, presented like that way, that he felt like an idiot not to have understood it earlier.

"Don't feel bad about it, Mister Pokhastovine.
Parent rarely realize what state of mind their children are in.
When they are young, they still show their emotions.
When they are teenagers, it is very hard to understand their existential questions.
Will Lady Kemenov be freed soon?"

"This morning.
First thing, normally," Sergei mumbled.

"I'll advise you to see her and quickly talk to her about Mister kemenov.
If she is available, I would like to see Vladmir take a week off, preferably in Russia, and that he sees a psychomage…"

Sergei thought that he knew an excellent one, but he would not give the Hogwarts Matron his name.
Although she had seen him several times, it was not certain that recommending Grigori Efimovitch Rasputing to help Vladmir was a good idea."

"… maybe even Mister Rasputin.
I think he had the necessary psychology background, and his knowledge of Mister Kemenov can help him find his true problems, especially if, like I suspect, he was the one who taught him Occlumency."

Sergei went slack-jawed, which made the Matron laugh before she threw him out in the early morning before waking up the Gemini.

The dismissed campired then went to Augusta's office, travelling through the shadows to avoid being seen by the students.
He preferred to avoid scaring them with the presence of a vampire in the school…

Arriving at his destination, he immediately went to the chimney, still taking the time to greet the old witch and the Founders with a nod, who were catching up after a thousand years of absence.

"Atrium of the Ministry for Magic," Sergei declared, throwing a handful of Floo powder in the continually burning hearth.

He stepped into the chimney and ignored the usual unpleasant feeling of this form of transportation.
He landed in the huge entrance hall of the Ministry for Magic, and in aone fell swoop put his hood over his face.
It was not necessary to get noticed there as well, even if he could legally walk in the atrium since a month before.
One of the many reforms Lucius Malfoy had promised when he was sworn into the role of Minister for Magic.

He introduced himself at the reception and slightly pulled up his hood so that the reception witch and the Auror on duty could see his face.

"Sergei Dimitrovitch Pokhastovine, Russian.
I come to see Katya Annapovna Kemenov, currently detained by the Department of Magical Law Enforcement."

"Wand?"

"Not since I was transformed," Sergei smiled.

The short witch looked up sharply and opened her eyes wide when she saw the vampire in front of her.

"You… I…"

The Auror on duty, a young witch with purple hair, put a hand on the shoulder of the reception secretary and gave the vampire a smile.

"A drop of your blood will be necessary, Sir."

Sergei nodded and held out his hand.
The secretary leaned away slightly, scared, which made the young Auror roll her eyes.
She visibly held back a laugh as she took Sergei's hand and pricked one of his fingers with a small pin.

"You have already come several times," the Auror noted.

Seeing that the secretary was not enthusiastic at the idea of doing the work for a vampire, the young Auror filled in the paperwork herself after asking for the resaon for his visit once more.
She eventually gave him an authorization card.

"Have a good day, Knyaz Pokhastovine," the young witch smiled, as her hair was slightly changing colour, getting to a more pinkish tint?
Sergei was sure that the humans did not see anything, the nuance being too small for them to see it.

"Thank you Miss… Tonks," he smiled back, his eyes staring at the hair, which took a more pronounced colour, as she blushed slightly.
"Have a nice day," he added.

The vampire turned towards the Department of Magical Law Enforcement, and more precisely the Auror Office.
Sergei went past the office of the magical police force, then arrived at the door of the office.

"What can i do for you?" and old wizard wearing the famous red robes asked.

"I am coming for Katya Annopovna Kmeenov," Sergei declared, sighing when the Auror frowned at the race of the bing in front of him.

"She has gone a few minutes ago with the secretary of the Minister for Magic."

"Sergei raised a questionning eyebrow.

"In the worridor on the right.
Back stairs.
First floor," the wizard sighed.
"With your vampiring speed, you should get to them quickly."

Sergei thanked him with a nod and followed the directions in a few seconds.
He found Katya not with any secretary, but with the Minister for Magic.
He felt a small pinch in his heart for Vladmir.

"Sergei?" Katya asked, surprised.

"Lucius," Sergei quickly greeted him, before turning to his friend.
"We need to talk Katya…"

"Of course.
I'll see you tonight," Katya added to Lucius, before tenderly kissing him.

"No," Sergei said flatly.
"Quite urgent clan matters risk keeping you busy for the whol week."

This time, both of them frowned and Katya had a worried look at Sergei's serious face.

"I'm following you."

"We're going to Hogwarts," the vampire declared.
"Lucius…"

"Sergei…"

The Russians silently walked to the Atrium, then arrived in Hogwarts, arriving in the Headmistress's office.

"Katya?
You are free?" Augusta was surprised.

"Yes, but I still have a few things pending and…"

"… can we have a private room?" Sergei asked slowly, piercing gaze on the old witch.

"Of course," the Hogwarts Headmistress said.
"Go to my appartments.
Katya, Vladmir is out of the Hospital Wing today, and Poppoy…"

"Afterwards, Augusta…" Sergei interrupted her, taking Katya's arm to softly guide her towards the door the witch had pointed to.

Katya exploded the moment Sergei had closed the door of the Headmistress's appartments.

**"What is wrong with you, Sergei Dimitrovitch?"** Katya roared.

**"The problem is Vladmir!"** the vampire snapped back, infuriated despite himsel, and above all worried.

**"Is there any complication due to the cursre?"** the witch grew pale, immediately calming down.

**"No.
Well yes, indirectly.
Dit down."**

Katya, still pale, obeyed and looked at him, anxiety visible in her eyes.

**"Sergei…"**

**"Vlad…
Vlad is…"**

The vampire sat down and sighed, leaning over a chair, looking at the ceiling.

**"Vlad is afraid, Katya."**

**"Logical.
With everything going on and the clan war…"**

**No.
He is afraid you'll abandon him."**

**"That I…
_What_?"**

Segei sighed and asked her to take his memoried.
He knew Augusta had a Pensieve somewhere in her room, and he wanted to show her the conversation with the Matron.

Katya got out of him nearly an hour later, pale as death.

**"But… how…?"**

**"You spent so much time with Lucius.
He does not see you at all apart very rare clan matters.
You registered him in Hogwarts."**

**"Last year, with Augusta, when she poisonned him…"**

**"He did not seek help from you,"** Sergei agreed sorrowfully, still looking daggers at the door.
He did not forget, and did not easily forgive, and for now, he tolerated Augusta, even though she was his newly discovered granddaughter.

Katya whined, putting her head between her hands, mumbling on how she could have missed it.
How long had Vladmir slowly felt excluded for?

**"The Hogwarts Matron wants Vladmir to come home for a week."**

**"That's what Augusta wanted to tell me,"** the Russian witch realized.

**"It is.
I wanted to tell you beforehand."**

The Kemenov matriarch styed immobile for a while, lost in her thoughts.
Sergei could see that they were dark, judging from the darkness of her usually warm hazel that she had shared with her half-brother and their father.
Even if her face was expressionless, her features perfectly frozen by two decades of political and Mirage Court struggles, he knew her too well.
Katya Annapovna was devastated and was questionning her ability to raise Vladmir once more.
When the vampire was about to rebuff her to think something as stupid, she sighed deeply and spoke.

**"Sergei.
Cancel all my appointments this week and go see Grigori.
I'd like for him to come hom tomorrow if he is available.
Tell everyone that Vladmir is coming back home… and ask the kitchens to prepare a good meal,** she added more softly.
**"We have always celebrated when he came back from Hogwarts, changing this is out of the question."**

Sergei agreed.
Every time the heir returned to the Kemenov palace gave way to a small welcome back party.
After a few months of absence, Vlamdir always had his small welcoming committed with the members of the clan he was closest to.
His nanny and tutors, a few of his vampires, his closest friends in the clan…
It had become a small tradition, and not doing it was unthinkable… even in those circumstances.

<hr>

A few minutes later, Katya entered the Hospital Wing.
Despite her worry, she could only smile softly at the scene in front of her.
Kevin and Vladmir were calmly sleeping in the same bed, with her nephew's second best friend watching over her.
Neville was wearing his school uniform and probably would have a class soon, judging from the Matron's critical look.

**"Good morning, Katya,"** the Logbottom heir whispered.

**"Good morning, Neville,"** the Russian witch smiled, before turning to the Matron.

"Madam Pomfrey, would you have a few moments to talk?"

"Of course, follow me."

The Russian witch followed the Hogwarts mediwitch to her office.
As soon as she sat down and the door was closed, Katya's feature lost any trace of joy and became sad and haunted.

"You talked to Mister Pokhastovine," the Mediwitch noted.

The Kemenov matriarch slowly nodded.

"Contrary to what you are thinking, you are not the only one to face a child's emotional distress," Pomfrey said softly.
"You are actually handling it better than most."

Katya raised a very familiar sarcastic eyebrow, which made the Hogwarts Matron laugh slightly.

"You spent too much time with Severus.
By the way, he is the one to manage many students in the same situation as Vladmir.
Many children with high-ranking officers of the Ministry for Magic."

"Draco?
Neville?" the Russian woman worried.

"Mister Malfoy indeed had therapy during his first year," Pomfrey slowly conceded, visibly hesitating to break medical confidentiality.
However, she could clearly see the ring on the witch's finger.

"With Narcissa Black who never showed her son any sign of maternal love, and Lord Malfoy who was overworked, Draco had a few problems.
As for Mister Longbottom, I cannot tell you anything."

Katya slowly nodded slowly, turning the ring on her finger.
The Mediwitch guessed that it was recent and that the witch was not used to wearing a ring on this specific finger.

"Does Vladmir know?" she asked, pointing to the ring.

"No," Katya whispered.

"Please don't wear it for now.
Talk about it later.
Right now, it would only unconsciously strenghten his feelings, even if he would be delighted for you."

Katya sighed deeply, and asked herself softly what she could do to comfort Vladmir.

"Take a week off with him, like when he was still home and sick."

Katya nodded slowly and took the time to talk for a few minutes with the wtich, before going to Augusta to say that Vladmir would not attend classes for the week.
She also told Aleksei.
Vladmir would only be back on Saturday for the first task.

**"Is he sick?"** the young Russian worried, sitting down with his Durmstrang friends in one of Hogwarts' many stairs.

**"Yes,"** the Russian witch said softly.

It was not a lie, but not entirely the truth, and Vladmir's friend seemed to understand it.
Something serious was going on, and he promised himself he would send him a letter.

<hr>

The Katya and Vlamdir returned to Russia.
For now, the young man did not know why, and he understood it even less.
He had no reason to return to the Kemenov palace in the middle of a week with lessons, however, he quickly forgot his questions when, as always, the whole clan was gathered for his return.

It was only when he got time alone with his aunt that same evening that he could ask the question.
They were both sitting down in front of the library room's chimney in Katya's appartments, a small ritual that had always existed, as far as his memories went.
When he was young, Vladmir was doing his homework on the rug, cosying in front of the fire, while his aunt was reading reports, busy with mail, or simply read an old familial grimore.

> "Hey auntie, I need to talk about my family for school!"
>
> A young six-year-old Valdmir was smiling from ear to ear.
> He was lying down on the carpet, Katya sitting down in front of him, his Potions book on her lap, and dozens of plants spread out in front of them so that he could recognise them.
>
> She had just come home from a week away, and Vladmir had seen the enormous pile of papers on her desk when he had asked for her help with homework, but she had come nontheless.
>
> "Well, who do you want to talk about?" Katya smiled, pointing to a shrunken a sickly yellow plant.
>
> "_Glaius gobelinus_, the Goblins' Herm.
> For energy potion.
> I want to talk about dad, mom, Sergei, baby Tashka, grandad Vassili, and you!"
>
> "Well, I don't see the problem," the witch smiled softly, pointing to another plant.
> Vlamdir gave its name, then whinced.
>
> "I have to explain the magical and familial links bounding me to all of you."
>
> "Hmmm…
> You know the family links between your parents, grandad Vaddili and myself.
> For Sergei, you can explain that he is a close friend of the clan and your honorary godfather.
> Natashka is your honorary little sister, since she is the only child in the clan and you like to take care of her.
> And you mustn't forget to say that while you don't have blood links with some…"
>
> "The most important are the links of the heart!" young Vladmir babbled, a large smile on his round face.

**"Vladmir, you know I love you, don't you?"**

Vladmir was pulled out of his memories by his aunt's voice, a calm whisper against his ear.
He felt something run on his cheek, and was stupefied when he realized he was crying.
Katya's arms around him tightened, and he sighed as he put his head on her shoulder, trying to hide his tears from her.

**"I know,"** he whispered.

But then, why was he still crying, and why was he afraid?
It was that same question he asked one of his family's closest friends, two days later.

<hr>

Grigori Rasputin carefully looked a the young man in front of him.
Vladmir still seemed calm, even after a two-hours long conversation on his anxiey.
He had just told him about the scene in the library.
He had eventually fell asleep on his aunt's lap, as he used to do when he was a child, only to wake up nine hours later, Katya softly petting his hair while reading a book.

The most famous Dark Mage in Russia was distractedly running his hand on his beard while listening to his youngest apprentice.
He knew children psychology well.
After all, his first important job after he had started to study magic, was personal Mediwizard to young Tsesarevitch Alexei, son of Nicholas II of Russia.
The young man had suffered from anemia so severe that only a wizard could save him, but also a number of irrational fears that made him psychologically weak.
They were so strong that Grigori had thought for some time that they were linked to a powerful curse.

Suddenly, the Dark Mage looked at Vladmir, sitting down in front of him, quite palle.
He could see his wife gaze protectingly at the young Russian from one of the corners of the library, clearly worried about him, but also the dark circles underneath the emerald green eyes.

Reality struck him with full force.
It was not at all the fault of a repressed psychological problem like the Hogwarts Matron had diagnosed.
And he remembered a conversation they had before he left for Hogwarts perfectly well.

**"Vladmir…
Please tell me you didn't try to approach a Horcrux alone."** Grigori said softly, discreetly gesturing his wife to leave the library.

**"No,"** Vladmir  replied a bit to quickly for the Dark Mage's taste.
He eventually sighed at Rasputin's serious look.

**"I looked for it to know exactly where it was hiding.
It is a small black book in the bad memory section, right next to the memory of my parents' death."**

**"Did you touch it?"**

**"No! I'm not crazy!"**

This time the Dark Mage could see that Vladmir sincerely thought what he was saying, although he seemed thoughtful.

**"What exactly happenned when you found it?"**

**"It was pulling me in, as if it wanted me to touch it to establish contact with me.
I was truly attracted to the Horcrux, but Kevin and Neville ripped me from my mind before I could touch it.
You…"

**"I think that, despite your memories, you touched it, which caused those doubts in you.
It is was is swelling up your every fear and doubt.**

**"What do you mean?"** Vladmir whispered.

**"I have known you since you were five, Vladmir Vassilievitch.
You have an unyielding faith in Katya, and you never manifested any fear or any sign of worry.
And I have spent two years teaching you Occlumency without seeing any sign of trouble.
I can assure you that it is something that shows in people's minds.
I will take a look in your mind, but I think I am right."**

Vladmir relaxed and looked straight into his eyes, allowing him an easy access to his mind.

"_Legilimens_!"

The Dark Mage knew he was right the moment he tried to enter his youngest student's mind.

Vladmir's library, instead of being welcoming as always, was locked double-locked, and he was faced with impressive wooden doors.

"I an sorry Vladmir," Rasputin whispered before violently forcing his way through the young man's mind.
Fortunately, he knew his mind's every weakness.
When they had put up the Occlumency shields together, the young man had created a sort of backdoor for his magical signature.
No one other than Grigori rasputin could have used this way and he praised Magia to have thought about this small opening…

What the Dark Mage found in Vladmir's mind reassured him.
Apparrently, the damage was minimal, but he could feel strong waves of Dark Magic coming from a specific door.
THe one containing the bad memories.
The one where the young man had found the Horcrux.

This new revelation put all the pieces together to explain the sudden fears in Vladmir.
His mind was fully under darkness, which he usually contained into this closed door.
However, the Horcrux's nefarious influence was now not only affecting Vladmir's bad memories, but the whole collection.
His every doubt and worry wa amplified, all his happy memories deprecciated…
The attack was insidious, made to weaken the mind in order to take possession of its host.

Grigori entered the room, getting face to face with a repugnant person.
A person he had never wanted to meet before, despite many requests.

"Voldemort, I presume?"

The thing was inhumane, but it did not surprise Rasputin one bit.
Splitting a soul was known to have a huge impact on physical appearance.
Grigori had grown ten years older, despite only creating one Horcrux.
The man in front of him had lost many human characteristics because he had created many more…

"Why are you?" the British Dark Lord, or what remained of it, said in a hissing and serpentine voice.

"Grigori Rasputin.
I would say that I am please to meet another Dark Mage, but I am not."

"And why is that?"

"First, you are parasiting the mind of my favourite student, who is also an already powerful Dark Mage in his own right.
Second, you advocate for an ideology that is far from my own.
Third, you are currently ruining the familial life and mental health of my student, my favourite one if I haven't said it already," Rasputin smiled affably.

"He is the one who did this?"

The two adult wizards turned to Vladmir.
His current appearance was representing his state of mind.
Fully clothed in black, he had the same dark circles around his emerald green eyes.
What made Grigori Rasputin shiver was the blood slowly dripping from the bolt-shaped scar on his forehead.

"Harry Potter," the wizard hissed.

"Vladmir Kemenov," he replied with a cold face.

"Vassili did not share my ideals, but Clan Kemenov never would have dared to face me!"

Vladmit burst out laughing, cold and cynical.
He quickly calmed down, but could not hold back cackling when he looked at the being in front of hil.

"The Kemenovs never were afraid of you.
While you left the USSR aloone, they had no problme with your ideas of grandeur.
Now, they have one a problem with you.
One sacred rule is to never harm family."

"Vassili happened to have a grand-daughter, who also happens to be James Potter's half-sister," Rasputin giggled.
"Clan Kemenov now has reasons to be cross with you.
Let me tell you, Voldemort, that both the Potters and the Kemenovs thirst for vengeance and blood.
Yours, and your Death Eaters'."

Voldemort's inhuman features turned into an atrocious face, but Vladmir reacted quicker than him.
In a few seconds, he fully took back control of his mind and threw the parasite against of the shelves.

"Grigori.
With us two, we can Legilimens his mind, can't we?"

"To know where the other Horcruxes are?" Rasputin guessed.

Vladmir nodded and Rasputin could hold back his proud smile.
The young boy he had known since he was five had grown into a string-willed teenager and an incredibly powerful Dark Mage.

As Voldemort's sould fragment was trying to wrestle out of the chokehold Vladmir had on him, the two Russian Dark Mages raised their wands at the same time.

"Legilimens!"

> A child that did not look anything like the Dark Mage in front of them hissed to a snake.
> The other child screamed in fear and pain when the viper bit them.
> With a satisfied smile, Tom Marvolo Riddle looked at the child becoming sick in a few minutes, and the others accusing him.
> But Mrs. Cole could not, or rather would not, believe that he had sent a snake to bite poor Miles…
> Pathetic idiot.
>
> …
>
> The dozen or so children were gathering around an old radio post, worriedly listening to the broadcated news.
> The child who would eventually become Lord Voldemort was staying in the back of the room, but was still listening.
> He could heard the bombs above them.
>
> "London is again under enemy bombardments…
> The Royal Air Force is currently riposting and three German planes have been knocked down over the city.
> For your safety, please stay sheltered."
>
> He whinced, despising the other children's fear at the sound of bombs detonating.
> Cowards, all of them.
> He wished that a bomb would hit the orphanage, to finally be rid of those whining brats…
>
> …
>
> "Who are you?" the same child asked, now around ten years olf to a man whose long white hair still looked ginger in places.
>
> "Albus Dumbledore, Professor at Hogwarts," the man replied, his blue eyes sparkling with joy.
>
> …
>
> Tom, older, was reading in the Hogwarts Library, whose layout had changed since then.
> He knew that he was a Hlaf-Blood… he only wanted the name of a powerful family.
> Then he would rebuff all the arrogant Pure-Bloods that depised him.
>
> Except he did not find any Riddle in the Hogwarts archives…
> He had thought that his father was a wizard…
> Such a disappointment…
> He started to hate his mother.
> With magic she would normally have been able to save herself and raise him!
>
> …
>
> The puff of fumes above the potion took the shape of named…
> First his father, then his mother…
> Merope Gaunt…
>
> With a bit more research, Tom Marvolo Riddle had a dark smile on his lips.
> He was the direct descendant of Salazar Slytherin, like the rumours that circulated about his Parsletongue ability said.
> Some kind of justice was still in this world, after all.
>
> It was time to claim his heirloom…
> Those arrogant Pure-Bloods would finally bow before him, and those miserable Muggles in the orphanage the old fuck made him go every holiday would get their just desserts.
>
> …
>
> He looked at Mimi Warren's corpse and the diary in his hands, smiling.
> The book had exactly described the process.
> He felt lighter, and yet connected to his diary…
> After all, it contained a part of his sould.
> Maybe he should create a second one, just to be sure?
>
> he slipped the small notebook over his heart and left, not even glancing at the cold body of the young Ravenclaws, his eyes glowing red.
>
> …
>
> "I came across a strage word, Professor.
> It intrigued me during my research, I did not find its meaning," Tom started softly, sipping on his tea.
> "I thought that a man as learned as you are could help me understand it."
>
> Horace Slughorn, flattered, gave him an encouraging smile.
>
> "Horcrux."
>
> He saw his Potions Professor grow pale as death.
>
> …
>
> The man looked like him… so much like him…
> Hatred slipped into his body, and he listened to him rambled for a few minutes about his status as a bastard, his mother's manipulation to force him to marry her.
>
> Despite himself, he felt respect for Merope Gaunt.
> She was a Dark witch indeed, manipulating men like that.
> Why had she stopped love potions, though, that what led to her death…
> But he would hate her for life to abandonning him.
>
> Exasperated by his pathetic father and grand-father who claimed that his mother was a mere gold diggin upstart, he cast a really dark spell that he had learned from Abraxas Malfoy on them.
> For a few minutes, he watched them writhe in pain under the Cruciatus, and a baleful smile streatched his lips when he brushed the ring of his mother's family in his pocker.
> Seven was a good number, wasn't  it?
>
> His eyes turned red as he raised his wand.
>
> …
>
> "You are too young, Tom," Headmaster Dipper sighed.
> "While you are an excellent student, and your marks are exemplary, I cannot accept your application."
>
> Tom Marvolo Riddle, his skin pale as a ghost, became flustered in anger.
> He swore to himself that he would become Defence Against the Dark Arts professor.
>
> …
>
> He was looking for relics to house his sould.
> His diary had a particular place in his heart, and the Gaunts' ring was a sort of personal vandetta, but they were ordinary.
> He wanted a link with Hogwarts, and what better than objects that had belonged to the Founders?
>
> He had finally found Ravenclaw's Diadem.
> The Grey Lady had been helpful for this, and since he was in Albania for Borgin and Burkes, might as well mix business and leasure!
> 
> He only need to find the necessary sacrifice for the ritual.
>
> …
>
> He immediately recognised it, having seen it in an engraving.
> As for the second one, he knew exactly what it was.
>
> "Could it be…?"
>
> "Indeed dear," Hepzibah Smith smiled, "it is indeed my ancestor's cup!
> As for the pendant, it is Slytherin's, a unique piece, I must say.
> I will not sell them," she added when he quickly turned to her.
>
> When Tom Marvolo Riddle came back two days later, she was immobilized before she had time to react.
>
> Terrified by the corpse-like appearance of the man that had just let some kind of illusion fall, the old collector watched the man prepare an old magical ritual.
> She knew she was going to die.
>
> …
>
> The hiker opened his eyes wide as he saw the man appear in front of him, as if by magic.
> He nearly fell down the cliff when the man turned to him, revealing a dreafully pale face and reptilian purple eyes.
>
> "You will do perfectly," the man whispered in a hissing voice, before petrifying him to pull him to a grotto in the cliff.
>
> …
>
> He had travelled far and wide to see what the world could do, best and worst…
> He had learned the Dark Arts to be a Professor, his goal.
> Hogwarts was his home, the castle had always been…
> It was the only place he felt at home, and he wanted to come back…
>
> Why oh why had the old fool refused his application?
> He was by far the most competent for it…
> Well, if he could not teach Defence Against the Dark Arts, he would show the wizards that they were right to fear the Dar kArts!
> It was time to show them the power of the Heir of Slytherin.
> And those pathetic Muggles would learn to fear the wozards.
>
> Meanwhile, he had to hide the Diadem in Hogwarts, and another Horcrux to create to have his seve souls.
>
> …
>
> Tom Marvolo Riddle was an atrocious name.
> Really…
> No power or Prestige.
> Thomas Gaunt?
> No, his maternal family was infamously declining, and no legitimate heir existed…
> Why not create a new name, then?
> A powerful name that would make wizards shake?
>
> A few hours later, Lord Voldemort, Dark Lord, was born.
> With his appearance, no one would associate him with the Slytherin Head Boy.
>
> …
>
> He look in satisfaction as Abraxas presented his son and several other Hogwarts students.
> It was time to mark his followers, and many celebrate it all on Diagon Alleay.
> It had been a while since they had terrorized a few Mudbloods…
>
> …
>
> "I have heard that the Mirage Court have saved several Mudbloods again during the latest attack, Black.
> They are starting to get on my nerves.
> You can thus make amends for the deplorable conduct your cousin had, dear."
>
> "Yes, Master," Narcissa Black murmured, bowing in front of her Lord.
>
> She shivered when a pale hand brushed her cheek and she raised her head to look into Lord Voldemort's inhuman eyes.
>
> "Tell me the name of the Triads," he whispered, "and I will give who what you have always dreamed of."
>
> Narcissa Black blushed and looked at her fiancé, Lucius Malfoy, before nodding.
>
> …
>
> "A prophecy, you say?" he whispered, observing his Potions Master.
> He had earned a strange kind of respect among his Death Eaters, probably because of his talent in Potions.
> "Show it to me.
> _Legilimens!_"
>
> …
>
> "No, not Harry, please not Harry!"
>
> "Get out of way, idiot!
> _Avada Kedavra_!"
>
> Voldemort looked at the tiny toddler that threatened his future, incredibly green eyes that held his own red gaze.
> He would be powerful, he felt his magic from up there.
>
> "_Avada Kedavra_," he whispered, casting the spell on the young Harry Potter.

The memories stopped, and the two Russian soldiers looked at the soul fragment in front of them in visible disguest.

**"Pitiful,"** Rasputin whispered disdainfully.

"You have created five Horcruxes in your memories.
I think another one was created afterwards, but you can't have the memory…
You have no use to me any more, except ruining my life…
I think this is just a rightful vengeance," Vladmir declared slowly, hatred clearly audible.
"_Avada Kedavra_!"

Grigori Rasputin fled Vladmir's mind, panicked.
He did not know what kind of effect destroying a Horcrux would have.
He grew pale at the sight of the young Russian lying down on the ground, not moving, his scar slowly bleeding.

He rushed to his side and with a spell, he enquired about his health.
He should have guessed Vladmir would do something crazy like that.
In a fraction of a second, he had the results and sighed in relief.
Vladmir was simply exhausted.

**"Praski!"**

**"Grigori, what have you done?"** Praskovia yelled at the sight of Vladdmir on the ground.

**"Nothing, he's just sleeping!"** the Dark Mage protested, his relief clearly visible on his face.

The Russian witch sighed and waved her wand to levitate the young Kemenov heir's unconscious body.

**"I'll let you explain to Katya why her favourite nephew is unconscious,"** his wife warned him.
**"She's waiting for you both in the drawing room."**

grigoru Rasputin grew pale in anticipation.
Katya could be terrifying when it came to her family.
