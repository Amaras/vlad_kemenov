## Chpapter 33: End of the second year

No one realized what the Aliiance did during a dark January night, and the small group was better off for it.
After all, they were a parallel branch of the Mirage Court, and as the good members they were, they had to be efficient and invisible.

They had thus restarted their usual routine, discvering that Kevin was a incredibly good liar and a natural Occlumens according to Severus.
He had resisted the grilling the Headmaster had subjected him to.
THe old man apparently did not appreciate that the Ravenclaw was awaken unexpectedly, especially since he was the only one among the five victims.

The lie had come easily.
Kevin simply explained that he awoke alone in his room, completely lost, and that when he realized that he was in the Hospital Wing, he waited for Madam Pomfrey.
Blood analyses the the Matron did revealed the presence of a Madrake drought, although no clue was discovered in the room.

Needless to say, the Headmaster had no coherent explanation, and that made him furious, to the great satisfaction of all the Alliance members.
Apparition was impossible in Hogwarts, Pomfrey's alarms did not trigger, and the venerable Headmaster did not suspect his phoenix.

In short, not only was Kevin back to the living realm, but they also drove Albus Dumbledore nuts.
They had also questionned another tacit rule in the magical work, to André's astonishment.
After having demonstrated that Parsletongue could be learned, the young Muggle-Born had shown that the arts of the spirit could be innate in wizards comin from Muggle families.

"It is a magical gift, as is Parsletongue," André explained to the Alliance youth, as Severus was brewing a lineage potions to confirm his ancestry.
"At least, that is what the magical world thought until now.
Occlumency and Legilimency can be learned, but naturals are rare, and only detected in Pure-Blood families."

The lineage potions had shown that Pure-Blood supremacy was not real, because Kevin Entwhistle was who he said he was, a Muggle-Born without any magical ancestry in the last five centuries.

Then the weeks came one after the other in a day-to-day routine.
Classes passed quickly, interspersed by increasingly original pranks by the Weasley twins.
Vladmir and Neville suspected the help of a certain Potions Professor, who strongly denied it.
Kevin and Hermione tempered and attributed the new pranks to the wonderful Slytherin laboratories and the accomanying store of rare ingredients.
Until the Ravenclaw Gemini discovered Severus's secret lab, strangely chaotic as ony the twins would leave this place...

Speaking of a laboratory.
The discovery of the Chamber of Secret had Severus and Draco filled with wonder, when he showed him the Slytherin appartments.
The mythical places were a dream for all the Slytherins who had ever been in Hogwarts, and reading the rare books of the library had turned the young Malfoy heir away from his dark thoughts.

Despite the nightmares that still regularly woke up Draco, they were only that...
The exho of his anguish and fears.
Narcissa, formerly Black, despite her son's worry, was regularly writing to him.
Her love for him transpired in each letter, and Draco was planning on visiting his mother during the summer holidays in her new cottage in the English countryside.
The former Malfoy spouse was alone, her friends and acquaintances had turned from her follwoing her decline.
One could not be close to a repudiated woman in the polite Pure-Blood society...
Draco knew that his mother was bored, but agreed with his friends: she had it coming.

Draco thus had found his good humour back and the Alliance had activated back under Vlad's unofficial leadership.

Once more, André had asked a favour from the castle, with the permission of the legitimate heir of the Founder.
His links with Slytherin explained how he could comunicate with Hogwarts so easily.
A passageway between the Chamber of Secrets and the HQ was created, to Severus's and the twins's joy for the lavs, and Hermione, Draco and Kevin's thrill for the library.
Needless to say, the Alliance HQ had gone from small room to lofty appartments.

<hr>

Days thus passed, until a sick joke happened on them.
Vlamdir and Kevin, still the earlies birds of them all, were climbing down the stairs to the Great Hall for breakfast when they arrived on a... surprising vision.

While Vladmir showed surprise by simply raising an eyebrow, Kevin grimaced in disgust.
The source of this bad joke was easily indentifiable, and gulped slightly when he saw the Muggle-Born look daggers at him.
The man, who had lied low after being ticked off by the Alliance, somehow needed another round to stop his excentricities...
And who better than Kevin Entwhistle for that?

The young Muggle-Born approached Lockhart and gave him a fakely innocent smile that deceived the rare students already in the Hall.
However, his blue eyes were glacial and he looked the man's fuchsia robes up and down.
Robes that were assorted to the decoration of the Great Hall, from the silverware to the standards of the four Houses.
Needless to say, even the most tolerant Hufflepuffs were disgusted to see the symbols in pink over their usual colours.

"Good morning Professor!
What a wonderful decoration, I hope you have planned nothing more?" Kevin asked with biting irony.

A small giggle rose up from the Ravenclaw table, and Vladmir greeted Luna with a nod.

"Aren't you waiting for ginerva this morning?" he asked, leaving Kevin to deal with their pseudo-Professor of Defence Angainst the Darks Arts under the disguise of a calm coonversation.
Vladmir sat down in front of her and poured himself a glass of pumkin juice.

"She will meet me later for the first classes."

"How is she?"

"Wrackspurts fly around her."

"Nightmares?"

"Some Nargles gnaw on her dreams."

"Regularly?"

"Blue fits her."

Vladmir sighed and wondered if he should ask the twins to put a peace potion inside their sister's pumpkin juice glass.
Fred and George had not stopped their evening ritual and still gave her a glass.
If Ginny still had nightmares, it could help her relax.

"THank you for her."

Vlamdir smiled and slightly bowed his head.

"Still Lovegood translator?" Kevin aksed, amused, sitting down next to the young girl and kissing her on her cheek.
"Hi miss!"

"Kevin, you should not terrorise our Professors like that," the young Ravneclaw reprimanded him, a smile refuting her words.

"It's not my fault he is stupid in addition to incompetent!"

"Who is incompetent?" Neville groaned while sitting down next to Vlad.
"My eyes hurt with all this pink...
Why, though?"

"I bet it's Lockhart," Hermione sighed, settling down.
"It's Valentine's Day, Neville."

"Whose day?" Vladmir asked, frowning.

"A Muggle holiday for lovers."

"It really exists?"

"Yes.3

"It's a Muggle holiday," Draco declared while walking behind them, "why are we suffering the consequences?"

"No idea.
Hi Blaise!"

"On the contrary, it's wonderful Dray!" the black Slythering exclaimed with humour, tapping his blond friend's back.
"Think about the wonderful love letters you will receive!"

"Thank you very mucj, I am a bit too young for this," he groaned in response, eyeing Pansy Parkinson.

"Come on Dray!
You have only become single recently, enjoy it!"

"I have always been single!"

"You were betroothed," Neville observed, helping himself to scrambled eggs and toast.

"To my despair," Draco sighed.
"Well, see you later, I'm hungry!"

Draco and Blaise went to the Slytherin table, and Kevin brushed his chin, thoughtful, while looking at them settle down, a smile on his lips.

"I bet you he did not notice the banners."

"I don't bet when it's obvious," Hermione smiled.
"He would have cried foul, the Pure-Blood way of course."

"The _Pure-Blood_ way?" Neville noted.

"He would have raised an eyebrow and would have made a couple comptemptuous remarks."

"he is a snake."

"Somebody knows what Lockhart has in store next?
Be cause I am sure it's only a beginning," Hermione wallowed.

"As long as he doesn't send us cherubs to recite poems left, right, and centre, I don't care," Vladmir groaned, painfully rubbing his chest.

"Vlad, are you alright?"

"Yes," he distractedly answered, observing the Great Hall slowly filling up, grimacing from pain.
The students expressions were exquisite, between entertained, surprised, revolted, and disgusted.
The last two were more from Slytherins and he thought Severus was going to have a heart attack when he saw his House's proud banner turned ridiculous by the emblem's flashy colours.
To his surprise, even Minerva McGonagall was disaproving her lion's dubious pink.
He could also see disapointment in her eyes when she looked at Albus Dumbledore wearing dubious pink robes with white hearts on it.

"Is it possible to have worse taste?" Neville groaned.

"I did not think so after seeing Lockhart, but I was wrong," Kevin sighed.

"Hermione, call Madam Pomfrey," Luna suddenly declared, her voice clear and strong, not dreamy any more.

Hermione, although surprised, immediately got up and ran to the Professors' table.
She vaguely heard someone starting to caugh and alterted the Matron.
Madam Pomfrey had reacted at the brutal coughing fit, perfectly audible above the Great Hall racket.

Vladmir had just collapsed on the ground, doubled over, as his panicked friends stared at him.
One of is hands was contorted over his chest, while he tried to wipe the blood that flowed out of his mouth, coughing increasingly strongly.
Neville, worried, leaned over to him, hile some approached in curiosity.

"Merlin!
Out of the way!" the Matron yelled out, running towards the Ravenclaw.

Vladmir tried to get up, but a new coughing fit forced him back on the ground, and he threw up blood, making some people scream.
Kevin and Neville, furious to see their friend seen as a circus freak, tried to push back the curious Hufflepuffs and Gryffindors, quickly helped by the other Ravenclaws.

"Mr. Kemenov?
Mr. Kemenov, stay with me!" Madam Pomfrey cried out.

Despite her appeals, Vladmir was growing paler and paler, close to passing out, and she pointed her wand on her the young boy to cast a diagnosis spell.
The result made her pale as well.

"Severus!
I need your experience!
He was cursed by a Dark Magic spell!"

Immediately the Potions Professor stood up from the Professors' table to join her, while Vladmir's friends held back the increasingly numerous curious students, leaving both of them space to work on Vladmir.
The fact that he was suffering from a Dark curse seemed to make the students frenzied.

Meanwhile, the young Russian was having more and more difficulty breathing, blood still flowing from his mouth.
He tried to keeps his lungs partially empty, but Vladmir felt that he would not last long.
What had trigger the curse?
Why was the haemorrhage more violent than the first time?

Severus arrived at his side, after having seen the Charms professor run out the Great Hall.
He hoped he would contact Katya quickly...
Then Severus cast diagnosis spells himself, observing the terrifying results writing themselves on a parchment.

"Ablus, by the Founder, do something!" the Transfiguration Professor suddenly yelled at the venerable Hogwarts Headmaster observe in fascination one of his students die in front of his eyes.
The old man's eyes fluttered, and Minerva McGonagall pinched her lips before taking charge of the situation.
She had to do something while her students were watching somebody suffer with a morbid curiosity.

"_Sonorus!_
Prefects please accomany students back to their common rooms.
The first hour of class is cancelled!"

For a few moments, chaos ensued, then the Great Hall started to empty under the Prefects' direction.

"It's a curse, Severus," Pomfrey sighed, casting a healing charm.
"However I don't know its effects.
For new, he has a massive lung haemorrhage.
_Repurgat sanuineum ex pulmonis_."

Severus got a vial out of his pocket, and reached out to Vladmir's lips, who coughed out blood before drinking the potion.

_"Repurgat sanguineum ex pulmonis,"_ the Matrong repeted.
"Do you knnw what curse it is, Mr. Kemenov?"

"No... Latin... Dark... Magic." Vladmir painstakingly answered, half unconscious.

"He knows Slavic Dark Magic better," Severus understood.
"Did you hear the incantation?"

Still regularly purging Vladmir's lungs, the Matron cast spells to try to stop the heamorrhage.
It was fortunate that he was able to absorb a blood regeneration potion, because he would only last ten minutes at this rate.

"I can't stop the haemorrhage."

"Cau... cauterise," Vladmir weakly articulated.

"You are crazy my boy!" the Matron yelled.

"He is right.
By cauterising a part, the haemorrhage will lower in intensity," Severus whispered, who would have rather forgotten the memories the word brought back on his minf.
Memories that he had seen in Vladmir's mind and his fight.
Cauterisation was one of the most efficient clan war tactics to temporarily heal a wound.
A method Vladmir was too used to, from the Potions Master's perspective.

"He won't breath!" the Matron panicked, worried for the young Ravenclaw.

"Cauterise 30% of his lung surface, it will ease the haemorrhage as much, and gives him some breathing room if you continue purging his lungs."

"Please tell me you know this curse..."

Severus did not answer and the Matron closed her eyes while casting the burning spell.
Vladmir yelled in pain, grasping Severus's arm as hard as he could.
Fortunately, only a few Professors remained in the room, and no student apart from Vladmir's friends.

"Out of the way!"

Severus and the Matron were pushed violently and the Potions Professor opened his eyes wide when he saw the man who was leaning over the young Russian.
Behind him, Katya and a somehow familiar vampire observed a man he had never thought he would meet in his life, while Minerva was displaying her usual stiff manner.
She had immediately contacted Vladmir's aunt and a few minutes later, the latter had arrived in Hogwarts with help.

**"You have a gift for trouble, Vladmir Vassilievitch,"** the man groaned.

**"GRigori Efimovitch..."**

"Who are you?
And what are you doing to my patient?" Madam Pomfrey panicked once more as the man was quickly cutting Vladmir's robes to leave him bare-chested and calmly palpating the bluish skin.

Severus caugt her by the arm.

"Let him do it, Pompom, he is Grigori Rasputin.
I think he is the most knowledgeable about Mr. Kemenov's curst.

"Ra... Rasputin?" the Matron stuttered in disbelief as Vladmir screamed in pain once more.
"Like ... like the Dark Mage?"

Madama Pomfrey continued to struggle when he nodded in response, trying to return to her student.
At Katya's look, Severus strengthened his grip and took away her wand, whispering her reassuring words.

The Potions Master had to admit that seeing a wizard slowly opening the chest of a human being without anesthisia could be shocking...
He looked at Vlamdir's friends.
Kevin and Neville were looking at the scene, completely expressionless.
Draco was surprised that Draco did not do that, but he hard turned away, paler than usual.
Hermione and Luna had done the same, uneasy.

"Grigori knows what he is doing Madam," the unknown vampire declared with a think Russian accent.
"My nephew is safe with him."

"You nephew?
I thought Katya had no..."

Severus fell silent, then opened his eyes while as he linked two important details concerning the Kemenov family.

"You are Nicolas II of Russia!
I wondered why your face was familiar," Severus exclaimed, an amused smile answered him.

"Indeed, although I prefer Nikolai."

Beside them, Rasputin was slowly getting something out of Vladmir's torso.
The Dark Mage was pulling a dark and sticky substance out of the unconscious young Russain's lungs.
He probably had cast some relevant spells, because no blood was flowing out of the wide open wound.
And it was for the bast, considering the enormous amount the young boy had already lost.

The black substance stopped coming out, and the Dark Mage covered it with a magical sphere, before levitating in towards Katya.

**"I do not know who taught the Fedovir, but it is an old curse of French origins, not very know, even less in Russia."**

**"So the Fedovir are led by someone else."**

Katya took the magical sphere and carefully looked at it, before putting it in her pocker.
She was going to study it carefully to learn how to use it, and especially counteract it.

**"You have the choice between Voldemort and Dumbledore,"** Rasputin sighed, obersving the Hogwarts Headmaster thoughtfully.
**"He has strong Occlumency shields.
I won't be able to pass them without his knowledge."**

**"Never mind, we will have tried this way..."** Katya sighed, looking daggers at the old man, who was talking with Professors McGonagall and Flitwick.
They both looked against him, visibly furious about his attitude.

"Severus, is it trued?" Katya growled, listening to the conversation.
"He did not react when the curse triggered?"

"Indeed.
He stayed immobile, looking at Vlamdir bleeding to death," the Potions Master carefully worded.

As did he stay behind when they were caring for the Kemenov heir...
The sudden Dark Magic aura that creeped inside the Great Hall was bad news.
Apparently, Katya was fed up with the man's schemes.
The three Professors jumped as they felt the sudden magical wave, but only Albus Dumbledore took out his wand.
In response, both Heads of House pointed their own on the old wizard.

"If you dare attack this woman, Albus, I will bear witness against you in front og the Board of Governors.
You looked at her nephew dying in front of you and the whole Great Hall without reacting!
It is unacceptable, and I am ashamed for the school.
You have to get a hold of yourself Albus!"

Katya's anger increased at the words of the Transfiguration Professor, and she slowly walked towards the three Professors, her face frozen in cold anger.

**"Calm down Auntie,"** a weak voice whispered.

Katya slowly turned her head towards VLamdir, who looked at the large scar on his chest.
He gave her a weak smile and accepted Grigori's help to stand up.

**"Thank you, Grigori Efimovitch."**

"Mr. Kemenov, what do you think you are doing?" Madam Pomfrey suddenly cried out, freeing her arm that was still held by the Potions Professor.

Vladmir looked at her, not grasping her words, stopping his repair of his clothes.

"Are you not thinking about walking away?
To the Hospital Wing, now!"

A low kaugh rang out and Nikolai walked towards Vlamdir.

**"Well, I'd say you're in good hands,"** the Vampire sneered, passing a hand in the young Kemenov's hair.

**"Apparently, she's worse than you,"** the involved party groaned as he felt lifted up by magic.
"I can walk Madam!"

"And I am Ministry for Magic!
I am brigging you to the Hospital Wing for a complete assessment.
You won't avoid it, young man!"

And under the amused looks of Rasputin and Nikolai, Vladmir was forced towards the Hogwarts Hospital wing.
Katya, for her part, was sill observing Albus Dumbledore like a predator.

"This time, Dumbledore, I have had enough!
I promise you will hear from me shortly!
I will track all your comings and goinfs, and the smallest infraction to your duty as Headmaster will be compiled.
I assure you the trial will stay in memories.
And pray that I do not discover a link between Clan Fedovir and you, or I will not give much for your life!"

The threat was perfectly clear.
If by any chance, Albus Dumbledore was linked one way or another to the attacks on their clan, then the reprisals will be severe, and especially lethal.
On this day, the Hogwarts Headmaster had signed his own death warrant...

Katya turned away from the man, and looked at Severus for some time.

"Where is the Hospital Wing?"

"Follow me."

Arriving at the door to the Great Hall, Katya turned back and smiled at the small band of students worried to death for their friend.

"Come, I think Vladmir will appreciate you being there.
He hates hospitals and similar things with a burning passion."

The five students did not need to be asked twice, and they joined them before walking down the school's corridors.

"When did the old Animagus cat change her mind?" Katya asked as they climbed up the stairs.

"She did not hange her way of doing on and seeing things."

"On hte other hand, she was aways like that," Draco added.
"She is somewhat like Godfather to the Gryffindors, except that she gives out some points to the other Houses."

"And that she doesn't take some away with agruments as spurious as some..."

"Spurious?" Severus choked on his pit, looking daggers at Kevin.

"I do remember our first year, Professor.
I believe you took away five points because Vladmir sneezed in class!"

"He was preparing a delicate potion, and the slightest disturbance could make it explode," the Potions Master retorted in bad faith.

"Of course, the cure for boils is delicate," the Ravenclaw laughed as he pushed the Hospital Wing door and held it for his friends.

He did not see Severus' amused looks, not Draco's proud gaze.
His friends had already taken on the manners of nobility.
He did some things spontaneously, as did Hermione.
Gallantry and politeness were part of those things.

The spectacle in front of them was pretty good.
Vladmir had been tied up on his bed, and a furious Matron was coming and going around him, casting diagnosis spells on him.

"Never had a patient this annoying... Fleeing..." the old woman mumbled.

"Madam, I have to admit that my nephew hates hospitals.
He had to go way too many times for his stay to be a pleasure," Katya declared.

Madam Pomfrey and Vladmir mumbled at the same time, and they both puffed up as they stared stonily at each other.

"Well, apart from a severe anemia, Mister Kemenov is healthy, and I am surprised he still has strength to complain.
Theere is no trace of the curse left!"

"Perfect, I will take a blood regeneration potion and bid you farwell Madam!"

"Don't you dare think about it young man," the Matron sneereed.
"I will keep you in observation until tomorrow morning!
In peace," she added, looking at his friends.


"Torturer!"

"Abselutely!"

"I think we are not wanted here," Kevin smiled.
"If Vlad can complain this much, he is healthy."

"Traitor!"

"It is for your own good," Kevin smiled.
"Not to mention that we have classes!"

Vlamdir grumbled, and eventually drank the blood regeneration potion and the sleeping draught that the Matron gave him.
He therefore did not see her sweet look Madam Pomfrey gave him as she freed him from his bonds and lie him down correctly.

"Under your dragon appearance, you have got a heart of gold, have you not?" Katya soltly asked, approaching to brush her nephew's hair.

"And he is still a child underneath his tough cookie attitude," the Matron sighed.
"I researched the Russian society, and I know he needs to be more mature than our students to survive, however..."

"He still is a child, I know," Katya sighed.
"I hesitated for a long time to get his guardianship, because our society is harsh and brutal, however...
I did not want to leave my nephew to those horrible Muggles.
Sometimes, I regret wrapping him up in the world of Russian magical clans' wars, like today...3

"He does not regrat anything," Severus declared softly.
"He is happy with his life right now.
More than he would have been with Petunia and her husband."

"You knew here?" Katya wondered, not looking away from her nephew.

"I was Lily's friends when we were children, and I lived near her.
If her sister has not changed since then, you did the right thing not leaving him to them.
I do not want to imagined how he would have turned out with them..."

Katya was allowed to stay the day in the Hospital Wing to watch over her nephew.
She stayed by his side, plotting her revenge Albus Dumbledore and Clan Fedovir.
She was also surprised to see how many students went to the Hospital Wing.
Admettedly Hogwarts was a big school, but she did not think it was possible to see so many magical accidents in supervised classes.
Between the Potions accidents, badly-executed Charms, or the small usual illnesses, there was always someone in need of the attention of the completely overwhelmed Madam Pomfrey .

She also had another surprise, this time bad, as she was drinking tea with the strict Matron.
A sort of horrible flying gnome appeared in the Hospital Wing and started to recite horrible verses.
After having hear a dubious metaphor about the toad-green eyes of her favourite nephew, Katya Stupefied the gnome and tied it up.

"Madam Pomfrey...
What is this... this... thing...
Doing in the school?" she asked.

The Matron only had a comtemptuous look for the creature wearing a ridiculous little tuft of disgusting pink hair, and a bow with heart arrows.

"An idea from Gilderoy Lockhart, agreed to by Albus," the Matron sighed.
"He wanted to celebrate Valentine's day."

"This ridiculous Muggle holiday?" Katya asked, frowning.
"While some of their holidays are quite enjoyable, this one is despicable in my opinion.
He allowed this farce?"

"I have to say that was not his brightest idea," Pomfrey agreed, "but anyway...
I fear those gnomes are meant to be churbs..."

Katya barely avoided choking on her tea and put her cup down.

"A _cherub_?
Did he ever enter a church to see how Muggles traditionally represent them?"

"I do not think so.
In any case, I feel sorry for the students that will get recited poems written by unknown suitors..."

Madam Pomfrey was right.
Many students fell victim to those gnomes, and got out of it ashamed or blushing from embarassement.
Draco Malfoy was the most targetted, but the third stupefied gnome sent a clear message to the other ones.
However, knowing how to use a fourth-year spell made him even more popular.
Kevin, to his surprise, was also popular, although the same trick Draco used allowed him to eventually be left alone.
Hermione, Neville and Luna were not bothered, because of respectively her know-it-all reputation, his role of Squib-adjacent chubby-cheeked boy, and her touch of madness.

<hr>

Time went flying by.
Easter arrived, and the week of holidays with this time of year.
Although, from Vladmir's point of view, staying in Hogwarts, even without the classes, was not really holidays, although he did not complain too much about it.

However, he carefully followed two particular cases that Katya kept him posted about.
The research by the Mirage Court on Clan Fedovir, because they had attacked on of its Princes after all, and the file Katya was confidently putting together on the Hogwarts Headmaster.
Once could believe that the threat of the Kemenov matriarch would have motivated Albus Dumbledore to free the Muggle-Borns, however he did not do anything more.

Needless to that when Vlamdir had learned that his aunt had contacted the students' parents to tell them that their children could have been freed a long time ago, he laughed out loud.
Lucius had asked for a summon before the Board of Governors for the 1st of July, the day after the end of classes.
He had been invited, as were Kevin, Katya, Draco, and many other.
It would be memorable.

Howeve,r one thing had not been forseen...
As Vlamdir and his friends were leaving the Great Hall to go to Charms class the week after the Easter holidays, they were surprised to meet no less than the British Minister for Magic.

"That's Harry Potter!
It is good to finally meet you my boy!
How are you?" a small and sweaty man exclaimed while offering Vladmir a clammy hand, his eyes staring at the lightning bolt scar that was clearly visible on his forehead.
Vladmir looked behind him, then gave the man a polite smile.

"May I ask your name?"

Cornelius Fudge's deep blush and the discreet satisfied smiled from Lucius Malfoy as well as the two Aurors standing behind the Minister clearly showed his unpopularity.
Some students laughed in the small crowd that was starting to form around them.
Vladmir had publicly declared his contempt to the man by refusing to shake his hand.
He could have briefly nodded to show that he knew the man and recognised his status if accepting a handshake, a very symbolic act to show recognition and an equal status, was impossible.
In this instance, Vladmir had just insulted Cornelius Fudge by refusing him his title and position as Minister.

"Well, well, Harry, I am sure you have heard of me before!
I am Cornelius Fudge, British Minister for Magic."

"Vladmir Vassilievitch Kemenov, Lord Potter, Kemenov Heir, and Tsesarevtich of Russia," Vlad introduced himself, refusing the extended hand once more.
"I would lie if I said it was an honour meeting you."

The Minister for Magic grew incredibly pale at this outright insult, as students and the two Ministry Aurors gasped in suprised.
Vladmir had a lenient smiled that would have seen inappropriate for a twelve-year-old student, if his fundamentally Dark magical aura did not dwarf the man's own.

A game of power was happening in front of all of Hogwarts' students, and the British Minister was not winning.

"Vladmir, maybe you should let our dear Cornelius breathe?" Lucius intervened, clearly showing his side.

Vladmir did not answer, but he toned down his aura, letting the man catch his breath.

"To get everything clear, Cornelius," Vladmir nearly purred with a predatory smiled, like a cat playing with its prey.
"I am not your boy, nor am I a British citizen.
I would therefore request you cease all forms a familiarity with me.
I doubt you wish to start a diplomatic incident with Russia, or do you?"

"The Russian Empire is no more!" the Minister cried out, wiping the sweat off his forehead with his handkerchief.

"I would adive against saying this, Cornelius," Lucius sighed.
"Russian society is quite attached to the old empire.
Contrary to us British citizens, all Russians know that the Kemenovs habour the last descendants of the imperial line."

"Now that this is all clear," Vlamdir smiled," I wish you a good day Lucius.
As for you Minister, let me say that before apostrophising someone in front of witnesses, you should do some research on this person to avoid unpleasant surprises.
However, this is only my humble opinon..."

Vladmir was about to get to his classes, when a known voice rose up.

"Mr. Kemenov!
Immediately apologise to the Minister of Magic!"

The young Russian turned to the Transfiguration Professor who, lips pinched, observed him from up the stairs.
Professor Sinistra quickly climbed to her level and whispered something to her.
Although Vlad thought it was impossible, the old witch's lips pinched even herder and she looked dagger, not at Vlad, but at the Minister for Magic.

"Mr. Kemenov, go to class.
Young people, you too!"

The crowd quickly scattered and the young Russian looked at McGonagall wearily.
What had the Astronomy Professor to cause this sudden reversal?
Normally, he would have been at least sent to detention for disrespect...

Going back to Kevin, they acted as if they went to their Charms class with the Hufflepuffs, but stopped at the corner of the corridor.

"Good afternoon Minerva, how are you dear?"

"I would be fine, Cornelius, if you had not tried to manipulate my students!"

"I..."

"Mister Kemenov is a Lord, and heir of two of the oldest Pure-Blood families in England and Russia.
Did you not think that your blatent disregard for etiquette you demonstrated was calculated to seem in his clan's favour, which could be regardd as an insult?" Lucius's voice rose.

"I..."

"Please refrain from such behaviour in the future, Cornelius," Minerva's voice snapped.
"For you, as for the image of the Ministry."

"They are only children..."

All paused, so long that the two Ravenclaws thought the adults had left.

"I believe you are mistaken, MInister," a low voice unknown from Vladmir slowly enunciated.
"Your faux pas will be on everyone's lips tomorrow."

"The black Auror," Kevin whispered.

"What do you know about it Kinglsey?"

"I know letters will be sent today to recount this incident.
Some of those 'children' as you say so well are acquainted with etiquette."

The voices grew inscreasingly silent, until they fell silent.
Vladmir and Kevin looked at each other, as Kevin smiled wide.

"I love that you mess up the school, Vlad, but this time was even better!
The Minister?
Really?"

"I only responded to his lack of manners in kind," Vlamdir sneered.
"He only had to introduce himself and not strut around like he owned the place."

<hr>

They took advantage of the calm end of year to chose their options.
Although some would be in a dilemma trying to decide, the Alliance members chose quickly.
Needless to say, they all took Arithmancy and Runes studies classes, although Hermione kept a secret from them, according to Neville, who did not manage to make her talk.

<hr>

Then the last month arrived.
The weeks becaume days, then the last hour of class finally came.
They were about to get out of Transfiguration, when their professor call out to them.

"Mr. Kemenov, could you please stay back for some talk?"

Vlamdir stopped and frowned, weary once again.
He nodded to Kevin to reassure him, before dropping his bag on the ground and approaching the desk.

He stood there and observed Professor McGonagall close the door with a hand movement, before standing up to look out the windown.
Many students were relaxing in the park, enjoying the good weather and their last afternoon before leaving.

"I am increasingly doubting Professor Dumbledore's true motivations.
I wish to meet you aunt to discuss them."

"To what do we owe this sudden change of heart?" Vlamdir coldly asked.

The witch's eyes showed sincere interrogation, softening her face as she stepped back to her class.

"You made my first year of class hell, Professor, and this year was barely better.
I know I am not gifted in Transfiguration.
However, I work for hours each day to try to get results.
Ask my House mates, if you doubt my words.
Despite all my efforts, I am still lacking, and you almost literally drowned my in criticism and additional homework, as if I did not want to work."

"I... your father and your mother..."

"My parents were both excellent.
My father was a Transfiguration genious and my mother got Exceptional Effort, I know, Katya told me about them and even showed my their N.E.W.T transcripts.
Thus, I will repeat what I tried to make you understand from the beginning.
I. Am. Not. My. Father.
I have my strengths and my weaknesses.
Transfiguration is my bête noire, ,and you never tried to help me.
As such, why should _I_ help you knw, when you spent all your time belittling me in class?"

Vladmir saw the witch grow paler during his monotone declaration.

"I..."

"Do not dare say that you had not realised.
After Dumbledore's trial, you became worse."

"I know I have no excuse for this.
I always trusted Albus and..."

"And it is time to get your blinkers off, Professors.
Now, if you allow me, I will take my leave, go prepare my trunk and join my friends in the park."

Vlamdir nodded at her sharply and walked to the door.
Before leaving the Transfiguration class, he stopped for a few seconds to look her in the eyes.

"One last thing Professor.
I am not an owl, therefore if you wish to contact my aunt, send her one directly."
