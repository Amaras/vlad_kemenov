## Chapter 34: Manhunt

Katya was standing next to Sergei in one of the most incredible places of the magical world.
She was wearing a stately outfit, and was the perfect image of pride and of the old wizarding nobility.

They were in the main grotto of the underworld to attend a rare and impressive ceremony.
Her heir and nephew becoming the first Friend of the Goblin Nation in two hundred years was not happening every day indeed.

July had gone quickly.
Vladmir's friends were invited during the first two weeks of holidays to attend the great summer flightracing event.
It happened in Spain this year, and they slep on a villa belonging to the Longbottom in Asturias.
They could celebrate Vladmir's third place finish, tied with Charlie Weasley.
After the rest, they had started bac work.
The small missions for the Mirage Court had gone one after the other, and Katya had been overwhelmed preparing Albus Dumbledore's trial.
She did not want chance to have any place, and she made sure she would bring him down as much as possible and eject him from his position as Hogwarts Headmaster.
His lack of reaction when Vladmir's curse triggered was not good for his reputation... especially when he had reproached him for letting a Dark Mage in the school afterwards.
Although apparently it had made the Transfirguration Professor react, as she had conctacted her...

Katya had not responded... yet.
The witch sighed and focused back on her nephew.
'No bad thoughts', she told herself.
In this start of August, they were spectators to a peculiar ceremony, in the middle of the Goblin Kingdom and they had to enjoy the immense honour Vladmir was given.

The Kemenov matriarch let her eyes wander over the city.
The grotto was enorous and house a veritable underground city.
Humans were rarely allowed in, so the descriptions of this world were rare and always duller than reality.
Contrary to common preconceptions, the Goblin world was green.
Incredibly greening in fact.
Plants were all over, looking like huge phosphorescent tree ferns, clinging to rocks and stalagmites, planted on balconies and the small terrasses.

Houses, mainly built out of curves, did not rise more than a few floors.
Only rare buildings reserved to public institutions rose over them all.
Wizards and witches did not imagine that Goblins could have schools, large commercial spaces, or even a comprehensive administrative system.

'Not even counting the impressive military complexes,' Katya tought as she observed the large base slightly recluded from the Goblin city, with its architecture radically different from the other houses.
And to say that Goblin military service was twenty years long...
Some wizards and witches should learn discipline with them...

She focused back once more on the large terrace of the Hobgolbin Klorgin Folblang.
Vladmir was standing there, along with the Lord of England, and all the other Lords of Goblin society.

Her young heir was calmly talking with the eleven leaders of the underworld.
THe ceremony was quite private, and Vladmir had been presented for a few minutes to the whole Goblin nation.
Thousands of magical creatures had seen him at their leaders' sides, and the new had quickly spread through this race of warriors and artisans so discriminiated against by wizards.

For now, Vlamdir was talking with the Director of the English branch of Gringott's, a Goblin named Ragnok.
Knowing him, Katya was convinced he was taking advantage of his new position to get enquire about Albus Dumbledore.

**"Do you think Goblins will help us for the trial?"**

**"I don't know.
I gave Amelia the file to make sure she know about our latest discoveries,"** Katya responded.

**"All of them?"**

**"No, not all of them.
Some concern the Five Families only, and I will evoke it with them later.
Exposing those in front of the Wizengamot would be like leading a lamb to slaughter...
The Heir must ot be revealed."**

**"I think Gwenelle Rowle and Amelia Bones will not like them..."**

**"Not necessarily, Amelia know Dumbledore is not fully Light.
However, Gwenelle..."**

**"She comes from a pro-Muggle family,"** Sergei sighed.
**"THe old Headmaster is her role model, and the charismatic leader of the first war...
She won't like those revelations one bit."**

**"I know."**

Sergei stayed silent as Katya was thinking deeply.
Eventually, he discreetly nudged her to get her out of meditation.
Vlamdir, smiling, approached them.
A smile that was not amicable.

"Director, let me introduce you to my aunt, Lady Katya Annapovna Kemenov, matriarch of Kemenov Clan.
My aunt, this is Ragnok 'Chicken-legs' Rodcor Folblang, Director of Gringott's England".

"You name is known among Goblins as a model of equity, Lady Kemenov," the small creature greeted her.
"May your gold be prosperous."

"And my wealth set in, Master Goblin," Katya calmly responded, bowing before the Director of the pretigious English bank.

"I have heard from a friend from Russia that the Kemenovs are not loyal clients of Gringott's" the small Goblin smiled, looking like a shark.
"I was thus surprised to learn about your heir's new title."

Valdmir's rictus became sardonic, as amusement was visible in his eyes.

"One should not put all his eggs in one basket, Director," Vladmir calmly said.
"I admire your people's talent in asset management, but we cannot be too careful.
Master of Siberia Gorkolk is perfectly aware of our position."

"And you are absolutely right in this," the Goblin answered appreciatively.
"European wizards and witches tend to forget that we all hold their wealth and this control the economy.
If you allow me...
What proportion of your wealth is invested outside of our subsidiaries, be they real estate, stock brokers, or simply Gringott's vaults."

"A quite indiscreet question, Master Goblin, that requires compensation."

"Of course, Milady," the Goblin smiled.

"Exactly half of the Kemenov wealth."

"You are provident, Madam," Ragnock congratulated her.
"What is your question?"

"It concerns your full name.
A part of its meaning is obscure for us wizards and witches, while you are quite known in England," Katya smiled, making the Golbin flattered.

"It is rare that we are asked the meaning of our feats of arms," Ragnok conceded, "especially from wizards and witches, who tend to mock them rather than celebrate them.
I am know to break my ennemies' legs, as we do for our traditional chicken legs sooup."

"Why do you bear the name of the Hobgoblin Lord of England?"

"Precisely because I belong to the clan that he has lead for centuries.
The name of a Goblin describes his affiliations.
I am Ragnok, of the Rocdor line, of Clan Folblang."

"If I may, do you have a relation with Nirseca Rocdor?"

"Indeed, she is my sister."

"May I ask you another question, Master Goblin?" Vladmir slowly asked, a detail coming back to his mind.

"Of course, Goblin Friend."

"What is your exact relation with Filius Flitwick?"

"He is my son," the small Goblin looked at his carefully.
"However, by the sacred spirits of the caves, how do you know?"

At everyone's request, surprised of this revelation, Vladmir patiently explained that the Hogwarts Charms Professor had admitted he was the nephew of the infamous Goblin money launderer, suring his first year.
Making the link was relatively easy once Ragnok admitted his affiliations with Nersca.

Finally, once the ceremony was ending, Katya had a satisfied smile.
She as right, Vlamdir had used his new title to get information about Albus Dumbledre.
The bankers of the magical world had agreed to give them detailed trasncripts about the Hogwarts Headmaster's accounts, on the condition that their implication was never revealed during the trial.
Katya had used an Unbreakable Vow to ensure the secrecy of her sources.

The three members of the Kemenov Clan were getting out of the Saint-Petersburg bank, satisfied by their day, when a tall man, entirely hidden under a heavy black cape, approached Katya.
Sergei let him, recognising the unnoticeable symbol of the _Sermirrov_, the Russian Cour.
The unknown man leaned towards the Kemenov matriarch to whisper in her ears, before disappearing back into the crowd.

Vladmir looked at his aunt and immediately knew that things would move quickly.
His clan's matriarch was only rarely having this face...
This face that made your blood freeze solid when her dark gaze was on you.
This face that made a man froze once she turned her head towards him.

**"Kitten...
Do you have your travel cape and your weapons?"** Katya calmly declared.

**"I do, why?"**

**"Let me invite you to a hunt, then."**

Vladmir raised an eyebrow, then a mean smile slowly appeared on his face as he understood.

**"Fedovirs,"** he purred.

**"Sergei, go back to the palace, and tell them we will not be here this evening, and maybe even for the next few days."**

**"What do I..."**

**"Urgent clan matters."**

Sergei simply nodded and disappeared thanks to his vampiric powers. Vlamdir looked at the sky.

**"A manhunt?"** he asked calmly, observing the clouds that were clearly visible on the deep blue of the summer sky.

**"Ivan Fedovir, Felix Darerine, and Ilyna Dolohov.
In a striking coincidence, they all are in the Dolohovs' English manor."**

**"If we hunt on the _Underground_'s territory, you should tell Lucius."**

**"This is not directly linked to the Mirage Court, even if the _Sermirrov_ is the main reason we have this intelligence...
This is Clan's matters."**

Vladmir's smile became predatory, and his wand slowly swirled in his hand as he looked his aunt in the eyes.

**"When are we leaving?"**

**"Now.
I believe we will accept Lord Ragnok's invitation to use their mirrors to transport you to England."**

Needless to say that when the Goblins learned the reason of their sudden change of destination, they only needed a few minutes to arrive in the entry hall of Gringott's English branch.

They both covered their head with their capes' hoods and calmly walked out of the bank.
Contrary to the Palace Square, Diagon Alley was relatively empty in this beginning of August, probably because of the cold rain that was continually falling.

Katya hesitated for a few seconds, then cut her forearm before enounciating some rugged words, then the names of their three targets.

**"Well, well, it seems one of our friends is not far from here,"** Katya said, amused.
**"Darerire seems to be somewhere in the magical quarters."**

Immediately, Vlad looked around the rare passers-by.
A redhead family, probably the Weasleys, an old wizarding couple that, from their tired walk, seemed to be around 200, an unlicenced hawker, two patrolling Aurors, easily identifiable from their robes, a few people alone and in a hurry...

**"Which way?"**

**"East,"** Katya answered distractedly, already looking around herself.

VLamdir frowned and swore in a low voice as a strange hiss came out of his pocket.
He took out a small scarlet sinning top that was quickly spinning in his hand, shrilling.

**"Why do you have a pocket Seekoscope?"** Katya wondered.

**"Gift from Nikolai for my birthday.
The Aurors are staring at us, and I would stake my wand on the fact that they are the ones making it react..."**

Katya turned her head and swore as the two Ministry wizards were walking towards them.
Vlamdir tapped the small charmed object with the tip of his wand to deactivate it, before putting it back in his cape.

**"Shit... Alastor Moody,"** Katya groaned.
**"A real pain in the ass this one.
He smells Dark Magic miles around, and hates everything near it.
Needless to say, our name will get us a trip to the Auror office...
Let's go."**

Vladmir turned around after recording the man's face in his mind.
He knew how to recognise Dark Magic scars, and this man was covered in them, including very caracteristic ones.
Laceration spells, nose breaking...
Nothing avoided him, apparently.
As for his magical eye...
It was as infamous as he was.

The two Kemenovs slipped in a dark alley, with many inhospitable corners.
Vlad noted the alley's name, Knockturn Alley, then followed Katya who was decidedly walking on the irregular stones.
They turned several times around secondary alleyways, looking behind them.

**"They're still behind,"*** Vladmir eventually declared, after several minutes walking the maze of narrow streets.

**"If we want to catch Darerine, we absolutely need them off our backs."**

Vladmir groaned as he let his wand out of his holster and get into his hand.

**"I'll take care of the Aurors."**

**"Be careful, Maugrey is powerful and talented,"** Katya whispered.

Vladmir nodded and slipped in the small space between two shops.
He ignored the rats that ran around him and the smell of decay in the niche, and waited for a few moments before seeing them appear.

The two aurors were vigilant, this place was pretty hostile to them.
The first, the infamous Moody, had his magical eye turning all around, watching everything.
The second one, a tall black man with a severe face, was ready for action.

"Get out of here kid," Moody's rugged voice suddenly rang out as he turned his head towards Vlamdir.

Vladmir obeyed, keeping his wand pointed towards the ground, the international sign of non-agression.

"Why do you follow us?"

"Why do you flee us?"

"You always have a quick reply, Auror Moody.
What are you doing here?"

"And you have a strange attitude for an eleven or twelve-year-old.
How do you know my name?"

"Do you plan on eluding my questions?"

"Do you plan on answering mine?"

Vladmir had a cold smile the Auror seemed to guess, as he raised his wand some more.

"I would advise against it," Valdmir calmly declaired while playing with his wand, a bahaviour he had taken from his best friend.
Seeing Kevin doing it all day long had eventually rubbed on him...
His relaxed attitude seemed to make the second Auror uneasy.

"Are you sure he's a child?" he whispered to his colleague.

"Certain.
And you could guess just from the voice."

"If you have nothing to say to me, I will take my leave," Vladmir smiled.

"Wait kid," the old Auror with many scar held him back.
"You are not from here.
From your accent and outfit, I would say you and your mother are Russian."

"If it was the case, I do not see how this concerns you," the Kemenov derided, voluntarily worsening his accent.

"England is not the favourite destination of Russian witches and wizards.
What are you doing here?"

"Family matters," the Russian answered vaguely.

"What are the spells on your capes?"

Vladmir smiled sardonically.
So, the anonymity charms on the Mirage Court capes managed to fool Alastor Moddy's famous magical eye?
He knew some people that would be delighted to know.

Then, slowly, not taking his eyes off the Aurors, he started to walk back towards a small passageway.

"Wai..."

Vladmir slipped back and levitated up to the roofs.
He avoided a red spell, probably a _stupefy_, and disappeared from the Aurors' view.
He was surprised he was not followed and, instead of running away, he stayed near the voices, protected from the bloody magical eyes by a thick wall.

The two Aurors seemed to argue about hil.

"Are you crazy Alastor?
You attacked this child!"

"He was oozing Dark Magic, as was his mother.!"

"It's not a good reason.
We have orders to shoot only when attacked!
Had he fallen from the roof and broken his neck, you'd have been in deep shit!"

"Those two Russians are suspect!"

"As are most of the people of Knockturn Alley.
No international conventions or national laws forbid Russian citizens on English soils, Alastor.
And you know that Dark Magic is allowed for them, even here!"

"This kid..."

"Was strange, I agree.
However, we have nothing against him."

"Failure to comply."

"Pardon?"

"If I meet him again, I nick him for failing to comply."

Vladmir smiled and sneakily walked away from the Aurors.
The day wizards manage to catch him without using Dark Magic, fairies will rain down.

<hr>

**"So?"** Katya whispered as Vladmir sat down next to her in a seedy bar in Knockturn Alley.
Butterbeer was waiting for him, in a glass that he did not want to know the origin and the date it was last cleaned.

**"Moody is a narro-minded bastard who holds grudges for too long.
But I have to admit he has a good instinct."**

Katya smiled a gulped her glass of Firewhiskey.

**"Darerine is in the corner.
I don't know who is is talking to, but it's quite lively."**

**"Wait..."**

Vladmir brushed his wrist and the bracelet on it.
Sasha hissed softly as she woke up.

_"Yesss?"_

_"Could you go lisssten to their conversssation dear, please?"_

Sasha poked her tongue towards the two men sitting around a large bottle, then nodded before slithering under the tables.

**"She understands English?"**

**"She does.
I spent nights teaching her how to feel sound waves, then decrypt them to make words."**

**"She is clever..."**

**"Of course, she's my familiar,"** Vladmir sneered as he drank his Butterbeer, but not before wiping his glass with his sleeve.

Katya rolled her eyes, smiling at her nephew's pride despite herself.
They calmly talked in Russian as Sasha was spying on the wizards.
It was half an hour before Darerine was alone again, lost in his glass.

Sasha immediately returned to inform them about the quite interesting conversation.
Apparently, the man that had met with Darerin was a certain Walden Macnair, executioner for the Committe for the Disposal of Dangerous Creatures, and known Death Eater.

After looking at each other, Katya and Vladmir stood up at the same time and walked across the dark and dirty room to sit a Felix Darerine's table, genious necromancer and Voldemort's follower.

**"What..."** the man jumped when Katya sat down next to him.

**"Shut up Felix,"** she whispered, plunging her wand between his ribs, while Vladmir, stting in front of him, put a dagger on the table.
The blade was sharp and deadly, and only visible to the Death Eater, who slightly paled but stayed proud.
His wand discreetly changed pockets, an _accio_ making it fly to Vladmir's Ddark robes.

**"Who are you?"** the Death Eater whispered harshly.

**"If I tell you we come to take care of clan matters, does it ring a bell?"**

**"You are Kemenovs,"** the wizard hissed, growing even paler.

**"Exactly.
We know that you are linked to the attacks on their heir,"** Vladmir quietly said.
**"Why try to harm him?"**

The wizard stayed silent, until an ominous cracking noise rang out.
Katya gagged the man a he yelled, only letting an inaudible moan out.
Some curious looks turned towards them, although the bar clients quickly went back to what they were doing.
It was Knockturn Alley, no one wanted to look at the others' troubles to avoid getting dragged into them themselves.

**"Answer or I break every bon in your fingers,"** the matriarch threatened.
**"Then, if you did not talk yet, you will get a guided tour of the Kemenov jails, and every bone in your body will be broken, several times for the longer ones."**

The necromancer gulped.

**"Voldemort's tortures are nothing compared to the ones of the Saint-Petersburg vampire clan, or Ubista's."**

The Death Eater's fearful jumps were not unnoticed.
Voldemort's name was still feared, event among his most faithful servants.
The reputation of Sergei's vampires was well established in the mercenary world.
As for Ubista's name, it was on all the lips, a shadow whose face was not known except to the members of clan Kemenov, but whose reputation alone made any one shiver.
Clan Kemenov was not without reason one of the most powerful clans in Russia.

**"I...
The clan was not the target, only Vladmir Vassilievitch Kemenov.
He defeated the Dark Lord and... and we..."**

**"And you wanted to offer me as a gift to your Master for his resurrection?"** Vladmir whispered, unmasking for just long enough for Felix Darerine to realise who was in front of him, his face deathly serious.
**"Were you the one who taught the Fedovir mercenary the corpse resurrection spell?"**

**""I do not know what..."**

**"Felix, do not lie...
I know perfectly well that your talent is in necromancy and that you are linked to the attacks of cland Fedovir against me.
I will not repeat my question a third time.
Did you teach Karzkern the corpse resurrection spell?"**

**"I did.
We knew the young one's death affected you and arghhh!"**

The scream of pain rang in the whole bar, making all conversations stop.

**"Kitten, you dirtied the tabled,"** Katya sighed as the necromancer was whining, his hand pinned to the table by Vlad's dagger.
The young Russian did not answer but viciously twisted the blade in the wound.

**"Bad luck for you, Darerine,"** Vlad hissed, his green eyes turning to the exact shade of the Death Curse, pulling the Death Eater to him by his ascot tie, **"I have a deep hatred for necromancers.
I have only one wish, to see you die like the dog you are, blood slowly pooling at my feet.
I am in a hunt, and you will be my first prey."**

**"Vladmir,"** the Kemenov matriarch warned him, guessing her nephew's intentions.
**"Do you really wish to do this?
You will tarnish you soul permanently..."**

**"Natashka did not deserve to die, but I accepted her death,"** the young boy whispered, not letting his eyes off the necromancer.
**"But that someone used her body to fight...
Using any body to defend oneself...
It is cowardice of the worst sort."**

Vladmir, showing a surprising amount of force for his age and stature, threw the necromancer over the table.
The Death Eater collasped on the ground, his injured hand curled over his chest, breathing heavily.
Terrorised by the Dark aura of the Russian, he had soiled his clothes, and the acrid smell mingled with the metallic one of his blood.

**"Run, Darerine;
Rus as far as possible, and above all...
Run as fast as you can."**

Darerine did not need to be told twice, and his face contorted, as Vladmir laughed out looud.

**"No, Darerine, Apparition would be too easy, wouldn't it?"**
"I call the Wild Hunt!
Deamonns of the ancient times, immortal Faes, eternal Sidhes, I offer you a sould.
Track down Felix Darerine!" Vladmir yelled in Old English.

Gusts of wind rose up inthe bar, as patrons screamed.
Vladmir's voice had risen, clear and powerful, burning with one of the darkest magic in the world.
He had called upon one of the first and ancestral curses of the magical world.
He had invoked the Wild Hunt and its immortal Lord.

Neither Katya not Vladmir bothered to follow Darerine when he fled.
However, all could see the mysterious shadows springing from the corners and slythering behind the necromancers, as ice cristals formed all over the bar and gloomy barks and neigh could be heard.

The two Russians, standing in the middle of the room, looked at each other sombrely, ingoring the panicked looks form the rare remaining patrons.

**"What now?"**

**"Now?
There are two people I need to track and kill for having tried to harm my nephew,"** Katya coldly declared.

**"Any idea where they are?"**

Katya redid her locating spell and frowned.

**"Dolohov manor."**

**"It will probably be protected."**

**"Indeed.
We need to get them out of there.
Let me think how to do that for a few minutes."**

**"What about turning the protections against them?"**

**"What do you mean?"**

**"Look at how our protections affect undesirables.
I think Dolohov Manor has similar ones.
How about we use those against them?"**

**"I am not sure I follow your reasoning, Kitten,"** Katya sighed.
**"Come, let me offer you a drink.
In a real glass,"** she added at Vladmir's surprised face.

Then, without at look back for the terrified patrons of the gloomy bar, they walked to the Leaky Cauldron.
They sat down at an empty table, this time showing their face to avoid suspicion, and ordered their drinks.

**"Alright, explain,"** Katya demander as the barman came back with two pints of Butterbeer.

**"If the protections did not recognise Dolohov as a guest, but as an undesirable, as they did not her two friends, what would happend?"** Vlad asked.

**"The protections would turn against them.
And since they are already in, they...
Brilliant, Vlad, simply brillaint.
And nothing would incriminate us.
I don't know how you would do this miracle, though..."**

Vladmir had a baleful smile as he leaned on the comfortable booth seat of the bar to looks at the patrons.
He discreetly nodded to the Weasly twins, who were sitting with their family a few metres away and seemed to understand that it was not the time to greet him.

**"I might be a walking catastrophe in Transfiguration, however I am good in another one, thanks to Rasputin.
Protections are often written in runes.
If I find one of the stons they are engraved on, it will be enough."**

**"I doubt we'll be able to approached their manor this easily, especially the foundations of their magical defences."**

Vladmir pouted, knowing that they could not reach this closely to the foundational runes for the protections without triggering alarm spells.
The young Russian and his aunt thought for a long time.

Vlad had caused a Wild Hunt on one of the most dangerous wizards in Eurrope.
He had done it on an impulse, but it happened to be a good play.
The Hunt was made of spectres and fallen sould.
The necromancer could not do anything to those, and his fate was sealed.

Except that now, the fact that the Hunt was started was going to run in the English magical society, with the target's name.
The other two would be wary.

**"Do you still have magical power?"** Katya softly asked as she saw Vladmir sigh wearily.
The curse could only be cast by a powerful wizard, which her nephew undeniably was.
However, he was still very young, way too young...
The backlash would be painful...
Until she saw him stand up.

**"I do...
Tell me aunty, why not call Ubista?
If the Dolohov are as vain as rumoured, they will not have thought about protecting their domain against House Elves."**

**"You are on form, Kitten,"** Katya purred with a mean shine in her eyes.
They put together their new plan of attack.

<hr>

It was the middle of the afternoon, and the good weather surprisingly came back, making the wizarding families get out.
Using discreet spells, Katya created a map of Muggle London.
Strangely, the Dolohovs, although Pro-Wizards, lived in the Muggle part of town.
Some incoherences in traditionnalist Pure-Bloods are better left untouched...

Once Katya finished her map, she stood up, put a few Sickles on the tale for the two Butterbeers, before putting back her hood and quickly leaving the Leaky Cauldron.
They went to the Muggle side, ingoring the perplexed looks from the passers-by at their quite excentric outfits.
In a few minutes, they found a dark back-alley to start their project.

**"Ubista,**" Katya called firmly.

The small House Elf appeared silently and bowed to them, wearing his usual dark set.

**"Matriarch, your Highness, what can I do for you?"**

**"Take your other appearance, we will talk while walking."**

Ubista nodded and his silouhette changed to show an elf around Vladmir's height.
His eyes were not so big, and had become two scary dark marbles, while his greyish skin turned to a more human tan.

Vlamdir put a Muggle cap on his still bald head, which also hid his too pointy ears covered in polished bone ornaments.

**"Perfect,"** Vladmir smiled.
**"Let's go."**

**"Pardon me Highness, but you are quite visible yourself.
If you allow me..."**

With a snap of his fingers, Katya and Vladmire were clothed in trousers made of a deep blue, thick fabric, pefectly adjusted on Katya and slightly baggy on Vladmir.

**"What's that?"** Vladmir muttered, touching the tick fabric, as their summer capes were changed by light cloth coats, spring green with a sober and elegant cut for the matriarch, and black for her nephew.

Ubista did not answer immediately, carefully looking at their outfits.
He seemed satisfied by his masters' white shirts, and smiled.

**"Denim jeans.
It is very fashionable with Muggles.
I have to admit the fabric is rought, however it is very resistant."**

Vladmir mumbled some more, uneasy in the clothes that sratched his skin.
Then the three of them walked out of the dark alleyway.

**"Now Madam, where are we going, if I may?"**

**"Dolohov manor.
It is located in the middle of Muggle London, a few steps from Buckingham Palace.
I will need you to get two occupants out discreetly."**

**"A kidnapping...
Who?"**

**"Ilyana Dolohov and Anton Fedovir."**

**"The one who tried to harm the young Master twice?"** the Elf asked bluntly, walking next to Vlamdir.
They were crossing  a shopping district and were not out of place in the crowd.
They seemed like a family, invisible among the hundred others.

**"Indeed."**

Katya was about to add something when an overweight child hit her shamelessly before gluing himself to a shop window, also jostling Vladmir, who looked daggers at him.

"Out the way you," the obese young boy growled.
"Mom, I want the new gaming console!"

"Of course my dear, you worked so well this year," a thin woman smiled tenderly, as her husband, who was as thick as his son, was talking with a woman way to round to be healthy.

**"Who would have thought that genetics were amon the causes of obesity... and congenital idiocy?"** Vladmir groaned as he approached the kid to give him a piece of his mind.
"Excuse me..."

"You think it's okay shoving people like this?" Ubista asked.

"You little brat," the obese woman yelled, "my nephew said he was sorry, I saw him!"

Vladmir did not answer, offended by all this bad faith, and only lokked at the small Muggle familiy haughtily.

"My I ask who I am speaking to?" Katya asked more calmly, even if her eyes told a different story.

"Oh my..." the thin woman moaned, all the wizarding eyes on her, as her husband puffed up his chest, not impressed by Katya's threatening eyes in the slightest.
Ubista sniggered when Vladmir mumbled something about hereditary stupidity.
The Muggle man was stupid not to take his aunt's perfectly visible anger into account.

"I am Vernon Dursley, director of Grunning's Entreprise.
This is my wife Petunia, my sister Marge, and my son Dudley."

"Katya Annapovna Kemenov-Potter, Duchess of West Siberia.
I will skip my other titles.
My son, Lord Potter, and our body guard," Katya introduced herself, trying not to laugh at Vlamdir's mocking comments.

"Po... Potter?" Petunia stuttered.
"Like... James and Li... Lily?"

"Indeed.
James was my brother.
I am more than happy that my nephew never stepped in your home, judging by your son's education."

Katya looked at the kid with pity, while he was still yelling that he wanted the infamous console, completely ignoring the adult discussion that happened next to him.
The contrast between the spoiled brat and her own nephew, although they were the same age, was incredible.

"You are one of those... those monsters?" Vernon Dursley huffed and puffed.
"One of those good for nothing that poison our existence?
We are honest citizens!"

Katya squinted, threatening.
She noted from the corner of her eyes that a shop owner was pointing them to two uniformed people, a few meters from them.

"Good for nothing?
If you did not understand already, Dursley, I am a hereditary peer of the kingdom."

"And I am..."

"Is there a problem, ladies and gentlemes?" a Muggle that the wizards quickly identified as a policeman interrupted them.
They had decided to intervene to avoid a brawl so close to the royal palace after the shopkeeper's silent call.

"Indeed," Katya calmly declared with a cold smile.
"Those people... just insulted us.
I wish to speak to your supervisor.
It is unacceptable that one of the peers of the kingdom is insulted without consequence."

"The Lady is right," the shopkeeper agreed, an easy-going and affable red-head, who was listening to the altercation from the start.
"Their kid shoved her and instead of apologising, the parents started to insult them.
I'm not bright, but I know a few House of Lords peers, including the Potters.
They liked my stuff.
The old Potter was a good client, quite excentric, but amicable for a Duke.
His son was a good fellow as well."

The Dursley seemed to choke in surprise, as Vladmir was carefully looking at the shopfront.
He managed to percieve a Muggle dissumulation spell that hid the full name of the shop.
Apparently it was a magical shop, _Oward's Technologies and Wizardries_...

"A Duke?
He was unemployed!" the obese woman yelled.
"He was a good for nothing alcoholic who killed himself and his wife in a car crash."

Vlamdir looked daggers at her, as Katya retorted with a mean look that as a Duke, he did not need to work apart from managing his assets.
Only Ubista that the woman named Marge was starting to slowly but surely inflate.

**"Vlamdir Vassilievitch, it is not reasonable,"** the House Elf chuckled, before adding a nuance.
**"Not in front of all those Muggles."**

A growl answered him, but the woman stopped inflating.
It was not the day to cross the young Kemenov heir, and Ubista promised himself to closely observe at Vlamdir to prevent a new accidental magic incident because of his anger.

Envetually, as the Dursleys were getting increasingly angry, they were all taken to the police station, with the policemen's apologies.
Katya reassured them with a smiled, explaining that they were not responsible for the actions of her sister-in-law's family's actions, who never understood what kind of man she had married.

"I think it might be for the better Madam," the policeman smiled, a mature man with a thick moustache.
"I belive those people would have tried to take advantage of your name's influence."

The three russians looked at the Dursleys be taken down by the policemen as they cried foul, and a gloomy smile stretched Vladmir's lips when he looked at one of the imposiing private mansions of the avenue.

**"How about we get to business?"**

Ubista only needed a few minutes to infiltrate the home defenses and properly knock out the two targets of the Kemenovs, as Katya and Vladmir discreetly Disappeared to their clan's home turf.
They could not stay in England for what they planned to do...

When both of them woke up, they had the unpleasant suprise to find themselves in the middle of the Siberian tundra.
They were stripped from their wand and tied up, and they could only note the presence of three people they hope to never meet: Vlamdir and Katya Kemenov, as well as a strange House Elf whose name they knew despite their hopes.
Ubista the assassin.

The next morning, Lucius Malfoy got up as usual around 6 in the morning and got down to the small drawing room to get breakfast.
He was surprised to see his son there, who tended to sleep until 11 or so in the holidays.

Quite worried by Draco's attitude, who seemed both nervous and scared, he took the time to pour himself some tea before opening the morning issue directly on page 8, as his son told him.
He was wondering what trash Rita Skeeter could have invented to worry Draco so much.
He had barely swallowed his first mouthful of tea before spitting it out as he read the article's title.

Lucius immediately turned the pages and groaned.
What had prompted Katya and Vlamdir to bring their Clan War on English soil, by Merlin?
They were not the type to hunt their targets in foreign spaces without telling the ruling Court beforehand.

> Assassination of Russian citizens on English soil
>
> Two Russian citizens, Ilyana Saprovna Dolohov, aunt of the infamous Death Eater Antonin Dolohov, as well as Ivan Borislav Fedovir, leader of the clan of the same name, were discovered murdered in Dolohov manor, London.

> The Curse-Breakers called to check the manor protections declare that no one could pass the home's protections without permission from the owner.

Lucius stopped reading and turned to other pages, reading over the financial pages and the economical column.
He stopped when he realised that he had not even looked at the front page and sighed.
What could be worse than three deaths as horrible as those.

> Sirius Black escaped from Azkaban.
>
> Siruis Black, candidate for the title of worse criminal of our time, managed the incredible feat of escaping from Azkaban fortress.
> The Aurors do not know how Black could leave his cell, located in the maximum security zone, but recommend great prudence.
>
> As a reminder, Black not only killed 13 people with a single spell, but also betrayed his closest friends, the Potters, by giving their location to You-Know-Who.
> His mental state, already unstable at the time of his capture, worsened due to the effects of the Dementors, and we invite wizards and witches to signal the slightest suspect event that could help our investigators stop Sirius Black.

The Lord swore unelegantly, making his son jump, not used to this harsh laguage coming from the so respected Lucius Malfoy.
The was going to be another Russian hunt on English territory...

"Father... Sirius Black is my mother's cousin, is he not?" Draco asked with a small voice.

"Indeed.
He was also Vladmir's godfather before..."

Lucius fell silent.
It had been years since he last thought about Narcissa's cousin.
But even if at the time he had not questionned Sirius Black's arrest, he rememberd two things, well, missing.

First, he never saw Black in Little Hangleton, the Dark Lord's stronghold, when he as the right-hand man of the Master.
It would not have been the first time he never met a new Death Eater, but it was till surprising...

Secondly, he did not remember attending Black's trial.
Indeed, he could have been busy saving face to avoid imprisonment, but he did not remember receiving any summon...
He would have to check his archives and the Ministry's.

Thirdly and finally, he had always suspected Sirius had betrayed his father, Orion Black, in the Triad, especially after he had learned of his betrayal.
However, he know new that it was Narcissa...

Lucius, lost in his thoughts, kissed his son's forehead before going to his office.
The end of the holidays was going to be busy.
The Kemonovs would hunt again...

And he was definitely not wrong.
Thousands of kilometres away, a young Russian was also having breakfast while reading _The Red Dawn_. He heard a door open but did not look up, recognising Sergei's muted walk.

**"Sirius Black escaped."**

Vladmir raised his head brutally, squinting his eyes.

**"Escaped?"** he slowly repeated.
**"This dog escaped from one of the best prisons in Europe?"**

**"Katya gave you the green light to go, and we have a pass with all the Courts.
I have orders to go with you,"** the vampire explained.
**"Your presence will only be necessary for Dumbledore's trial.
The rest of the time will be focused on the hunt for Black."**

Indeed, the end of the holdiays would be busy.
