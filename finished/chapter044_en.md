# Chapter 44: The End of a Flight

A deathly silence fell in the Chamber of Secrets, as all were staring at the impressive Marauder's Map that cas recreated on the wall.
A deathly silence caused both by the presence of this name so despised by Vladmir, and by the feeling of suffocating hate in the room, also coming from the young Russian.

Sergei was the first to arrive in the room, called in a hurry by Kevin while he was deservedly resting.
Katya was next, wearing her Mirage Court cape, ripped out of an important meeting of the Russian Triads.
Then Lucius followed, wearing the traditional Wizengamot robes, proudly wearing the Malfoy coat-of-arms on his back, leaving a session of the illustrious wizarding tribunal as quickly as possible.

The three of them turned to Severus, who was still sitting on the table, wiping his red qill on a blotting paper again and again, incapable of focusing on anything other than the letters on the map.

"What is happening?" Katya whispered, noticing the Dark Magic making the air suffocating.

Vladmir pointed at the name on the wall.
The reaction from the two Russians was brutal.
Katya's magic joined her nephew's, as she whispered curses to the traitor.
Eventually, she turned to Vladmir and sighed.

"Go on Vlad.
I'll let you have him," she whispered.
"But don't kill him, we…"

"… need him alive, I know…
Kev?"

"Behind you, my Prince," the young wizard smiled, taking his wand out, the one he had stolen the previous year and never given back.

"No way you are going alone," Neville calmly declared while standing up, a rictus on his lips.
"And he's an intruder on our domain, isn't he?"

"He's not wrong," Draco sniggered.
"No one walks the Alliance's territory without their knowledge."

"And there is no way that you go out on a full moon without me," Hermione sighed.
"I don't want to see you howl to the moon afterwards."

"There are werewolves in the school?" Cedric wondered.

"One, but he should have drunk the Wolfsbane," Severus sighed.
"I'll go check."

In a few minutes, the Potions Master went to the Defence Against the Dark Arts Professor's office and back.

"We have a problem…
Lupin did not drink his potion, and I found this on his desk…" the wizard said, throwing an old parchment on one of the table.
They had seen it enough to instantly recognised one of the Alliance's treasures.

"What was the Marauder's Map doing on Lupin's desk?" Hermione asked, turning to the Weasley twins, who were instantly uneasy.

"We, like…"

"… wanted to prank our younger brother…"

"… but Lupin caught us and…"

"… confiscated the Map…"

"He should not have been able to use it!" both readheads defended themselves in unison.

"Lupin is one of the Marauders," Severus sighed.
"Of course he can use it, and I'm sure he made most of the enchantments!"

The twins' blue eyes sparkled in interest, but they said nothing, while the Alliance core prepared to leave their HQ.
Neville took the map back with a flick of his wand, before smiling to the four adults.

"Maybe tell Grandma…"

"Don't you worry little man," Katya laughed, "we already took care of that.
And as Headmistress, she has access to information we don't have, doesn't she, André?"

"She is the Headmistress," the Sorting Hat sighed.
"She knows many things thanks to her link with the school.
Fortunately, she does not abuse it like Dumbledore would.
The castle and the portraits only inform her is the students are in danger."

"Vlad!
Be careful and don't hestitate to call us if you need," Katya declaired while watching her nephew and Heir walk thorugh the door of the Chamber of Secrets, a huge Basilisk and his friends following him.

It was getting late, and the students were in the Great Hall for dinner.
Thus, no one saw the small group silently walk through the great door to get to the park, while the twins, Cedric, and Luna went to eat.

They silently moved until they were away from the entrance.
The new caretaker, some Mr. Gregori, was way more competant than his predecessor, and he had a knack to find people breaking the rules.
As for the new Gamekeeeper, called Mr. Sawlings, whose familiar, a sinister crow, was a remarkable companion.
Just the two of them were making the Alliance struggle to avoid them.
However, the twins, who oversaw the contraband, appreciated this new challenge…

However, when they got out at night, they had to be careful not to get caught, especially since Sasssly had insisted to accompany them and they were not the most discreet group in the world.

"Where is the entrance to the secret passage to the Shrieking Shack?" Hermione asked, observing the huge school's park covered in Darkness.
It was overcast, hinding the full moon, and thus the natural light of the night.

Her question, whispered, got lost in the wind, as they carefully observed the premises.
Sasssly coiled on herself, pestering about the cold wind of this end of May.

"Under the Whomping Willow.
In any case, the Forbidden Forest is not advisable because of the Dementors…"

They all shivered at the memory of the horrible guardian of Azkaban, except Hermione, who shruged.
She was the only one not bothered by those creatures.

Thus, they decidedly walked to the solitary tree in the middle of the park.
As they approached, Sassly softly hissed to Vladmir and Kevin, who lokked at each other before squinting, trying to find what the Basilisk had notified them of.

"Mione, isn't that your Kneazle?" Neville suddenly asked, pointing the orange form calmly lying donw under the Whomping Willows's strangely calm branches.

"Crookshanks!
Merlin, where have you been?" the young witch yelled, running towards her familiar, ignoring her friends' warning, alarmed by the branches' slow movements.

Crookshanks purred loudly and jumped into his owner's arms as she leaned on the trunk to observe the strange cavity between the tree's roots.

Her friends froze a few meters from her, and she looked at them, surprised.

"Why aren't you coming?"

"In case you haven't noticed, Mione," Draco said sarcastically, "the tree doesn't like us the way it likes you."

Hermione blushed as she realized that while the Whomping Willow did not attack her, it was quite different for her friends.
Crookshanks wriggled in her arms and she let him jump down.
The cat purred as he put his paw on a node between two roots, and the tree suddenly stopped moving.
As everyone watched the Whomping Willow in astonishment, Hermione called them.

"Come one, I'm not sure it will hold for lon!"

They quickly entered the tight dirt tunnel, and Kevin felt a branch brush over his hair the moment he disappeared underneath the earth.
Neville, last in line, was less lucky and goraned in pain when a branch whipped his shoulder, narrowly avoiding his neck.

"Whew, that was close," Kevin jeered, taking his wand out.
_"Lumos."_

"Speak for yourself," the Gryffindor grumbled while moving his shoulder around, before mimicking the Ravenclaw.

**"Burn."**

A flame appeared in Vladmir's palm, and they observed their surroundings.

"Do you think the tunnel is long?" Draco whispered, listening closely.
Far away, strange noises could be heard.

"Someone's fighting," Vladmir whispered, taking the Marauder's Map out of his pocket.
"I solemnly swear that I'm up to no good. **Shit!**"

**"What?"**

"The initial map doesn't reach the Shrieking Shack…"

"Ah, yes, sorry," Kevin said sheepishly.
"We didn't manage to break the protections to edit it, so for now only the giant map shows the Shrieking Shack and Hogsmeade.
If we could get our hands on those Marauders…
If we are our contemporaries…"

"No problem.
`Sasssly, to the front,` Vladmir hissed softly, before adding as the Basilisk moved around him, `but be careful with your eyes, lovely…`

They all squeezed against the carved rocky walles to let the impressive magical beast pass.
Basilisk skin was one of the best magical leathers in the world, because of its incredible resistance to magic.
The keeper of the Chamber of Secrets would protect tham against stray spells while they reached the Shrieking Shack.

As they finally reached the house proper, the raised voices were nearly audible, but the spell deflagrations were clearly identifiable.

_"Nox,"_ Kevin whispered, quickly followed by the others.

"I thought the Shrieking Shack was haunter?" Hermione whispered.

"The furniture has been destroyed, and those are sratch marks," Neville said, pointing to a chair that missed several legs besides a pedestal table in tatters, whose tray seemed to have been gnawed on.
Bite marks were perfectly visible underneath the layers of dust.

"Wolf teeth," Vladmir slowly analyzed, lightly dusting the tray to look at the marks.
"Judging from the shape of the teeth, a werewolf."

"Shit…
Is this the wolf's den?" Draco whispered.
"We're a full moon night!"

"Dray… think a bit," Hermione sighed.

"Oi!" the blond boy mumbled, still observing his surroundings.
"Alright, those are old traces, but let me remind you that Lupin is around, and he is a werewolf!"

"Dray…"

"I like you a lot Hermione, and I know your Licorine powers have quite the effect on Dementors, but could you calm down an enraged werewolf?"

Kevin looked at Neville and impreceptibly nodded.
Neville stepped forward, but to their surprised, Hermione was the quickest.
Without any hesitation, the young woman breathed in and violently slapped Draco.
The latter, astounded, stumbled, putting his hand on his cheek.

"Wha…"

"Seriously Draco Malfoy," Hermione hissed, pointing a finger towards the young man's torse.
"Pick yourself back up!
You are ridiculous for panicking now!
So you'll get your usual arrogance back and proudly go next to Vladmir, Heir Malfoy!"

Draco stayed frozen for a few senconds, then laughed out loud while touching his cheek, a rather hysterical laugh.

"Thanks Mione," he said through hiccups.
"I panicked a bit…"

"You've met Ectoplasm Voldy twice and you did not panick then," Neville noted.

Draco shrugged and gave the others an apologetic smile, before putting his usual wand back in its holster and took the ancestral Malfoy relic out instead.

Behind him, Neville sniggered and got his father's wand out.

"We have a rat on our plate," Kevin whispered in amusement.

They slowly and cautiously walked through the dilapidated rooms of the Shrieking Shack.
Not a sound revealed their progression, the age-old wooden floor staying silent under their feet.
Even Sassly's movement in front of them, tacing a sinuous path in the dust, did not make any noise.
And the raised voices got more distinct…

"No, Moony, I swear that I did not betray James and Lily!" Sirius Black's easily identifyable voice screamed.

"Liar!" roared a voice that surprsed them in how hoarse it was.
"You betrayed them and you killed Peter!"

"Never!
I swear it on my magic!"

The moment they reached the door, Remus Lupin's harsh words suddenly fell silent.

"Well, if we had known that this was all that was needed," Kevin sighed, stepping over Sasssly's tail to enter the room…
The two men, facing each other, quite in a bad shape following their argument and fight, simultaneously jumped when they saw the young Ravenclaw student appear in front of them as if nothing had happened.

"Kevin?" Sirius wondered aloud.

Kevin did not respond to what was evident and let his gaze wonder in the run-down fbedroom.
His blue eyes became glacial when he saw a small rat in a corner of the room, half-hidden by a wobly chest of drawers.

"Mr Entwhistle?
What do you mean, _Kevin_?" the Defence Against the Dark Arts professor chocked, his amber eyes more animalistic than human opened wide at the surprise going back and forth between the fugitive and the Ravenclaw who seemed to know each other.

"I thought werewolves had a better hearing?" Hermione wondered, appearing in time.

"Good evening, dear cousin," Draco laughed, stepping inside the room.

"Stupid Godfather," Vladmir grumbled.
"What are you doing here?"

"Lucius told me," the fugitive mumbled.
"Where is he?"

_"Stupefy!"_ Neville sighed, pointing his wand towards a dark corner of the room.
"Why do I have to do the dirty work?"

Vladmir prevented his godfather from immediately jumping on the immobilised rat and winked at him, while the Defence Agains the Dark Arts professor was astounded.

"What are you doing here?" Remus stuttered.
"You are breaking…"

"Exactly 17 Hogwarts rules," Hermione agreed very pedantically while Crookshanks, who had calmly followed them, went to fetch a thin stupefied rat in the corner of the room.

"However, yo ucompletely forgot your Wolfsbane Potion," Kevin sighed.
"And Severus…"

"… had us tell you that next time, he will cut you into Potions ingredients," Vlad continued.

"Drink up," Draco groaned, pointing to a Potion vial that Hermione gave him.
"I don't want to have a werewolf on my back…"

The two adults could only look speechlessly at the five students in front of them.
Hermione, who held her wand in her right hand and a potion vial that Professor Lupin identified easily.
Vladmir who was leaning on nothing less than a gigantic serpant head and who looked at them with a slight spark of amusement in his eyes;
Kevin, who was petting a huge purring cat with a satisfied smiled, which the Kneazle shared, quite the disturbing sight for the two wizards.
Draco, who was desperately wiping a corner of his black cape that was covered in dust.
And Neville, who was holding with visible disgust an old stupefied rat that he had taken from Crookshanks's paxs.

"What do you mean, _Stupefy_?" Professor Lupin finally noted.

"35 seconds of reaction time… that's harsh," Draco sighed, straightening up.

"Merlin, how do you know?" Sirius whispered, before seeping the Marauder's Map in Vladmir's hands.

"Never mind.
It's quite true that you five are worse than James and us," the Azkaban fugitive chuckled.

"Don't talk about James!" Professor Lupin suddenly screamed.
"You betrayed him, you bastard!"

"Blimey Moony!
The stubborn ones were James and me, not you!
I swore on my magic that I did not betray James!"

"Then who?!
Who betrayed them?"

"Take a guess."

"No…
It's not possible.
You killed him…"

"The only thing that was found of him was a finger," Vladmir declared calmly.
"And it's pretty easy to cut a finger."

"How…
Why didn't you say anything in your trial?
This simple oath would have sufficed…"

"What trial?" Sirius whispered gloomily.
"I never had a trial?
Who made you think that?"

"Albus…"

"The bast…" Vlad grumbled, promissing a death by a thousand cuts to the wold wizard when he got his hands on hil.

"Vladmir!"

"It is scheduled for this summer," Draco declared with a smile as Remlus Lupin sat down on the bed, sending a cloud of dust flying.
Under the eyes of the Alliance, the man put his head in his hands and started to sob.

"He's not an Alpha," Kevin declared softly.

"Certainly.
Not even a Beta," Neville agreed.

"But he is dominant, otherwise he would have survived without a pack…" Hermione sighed, kneeling down in front of the werewolf.
Lupin nearly immediately raised his head and stared at the young woman, frozen by the sudden feeling of peace.

"What are you?" he finally whispered.

"I am surprised that you never asked sooner, but you have to find the answer yourself."

Remus Lupin intensely looked at the Gryffindor's hazel eyes, remembering the rare times he felt appeased in her presence.
Meanwhile, Sirius was observing the rat Neville was holding out with a visceral hatred.

"Here Vlad, he's all yours," the Gryffindor eventually said, throwing the rat at him.

_"Crucio."_

The rat's curve in the air suddenly stopped and he dropped harshly under the effect of the Dark Magic spell cast by Vlad, whose eyes had become black in hate and burned coldly;
Neville's gaze became haunted as he grew pale, and the Russian immediately noticed.

"What…?"

To Remus Lupin's surprise, it was young Hermione Granger who prevented him from stopping this act of pure violence that he would have never imagined from Jame and Lily Potter's son.
By Magia, he was using an Unforgivable!
And what scared Remus the most was that, judging from Sirius's face, it was not surprising.
Despite all he knew about Russians and the Clans, to see that Valdmir was so familiar with Dark Magic and especially, that he had so much bad emotions to cast that curse…

"Sorru Nev," Vladmir groaned as he canceled the spell.

"I understand your hatred," Neville whispered," but you can choose the curse, please use another one."

"Wait a minute guys," Draco sighed.
"I think Sirius has a few questions to ask our dear traitor."

"Indeed.
Moony?"

"Together…" Remus whispered.
"On the count of three…
One…
Two…
Three!"

A blue spark sprang from both wands towards the rat on the ground, which started to convulse.
Then extremely quickly, a head appeared, then arms, then feet…
In a few seconds, a man was kneeling in front of them, at the exact spot where the former Weasley rat was.

"A true rat," Draco noted, scrunching his nose up in desgust at the bland and dirty looks of the man.

"Peter…"

"Si…
Sirius…
Re…
Remus…"

This time, Kevin was the one to cringe at the small voice.
However, no one missed him looking at the door.

"My friends…"

"I am not sure it is the right word," Neville declared.

"We have had a small discussion, Peter, but I think you heard it…" Remus declared gloomily.
"Do you have anything else to say other than the fact that you betrayed James and Lily?"

"Harry…" the Animagus tried, turning to the young students.
"I… I did not do anything!"

"After three years around Gryffindors, you never learned that my name is Vladmir?" the Russian laughed.
"Come on Peter…
And if you are as innocent as you say, why did you hide for twelve long years?"

"I… I knew he would chase me, that he would find me!"

"You knew he would escape?" Kevin noted.
"When no one ever escaped Azkaban?"

"He knows Dark Magic processes that we don't know of!" Pettigrew yelled.

"We are talking about Sirius Black here," Draco was amused.
"The man who fled home to escape his familiy's 'dark' influence."

"He is the last person who would join Voldemort," Hermione agreed.

Although Remus Lupin and Sirius Black flinched at the name of the Dark Lord, Pettigrew's reaction was way more surprising.
The wail of terror could have moved them, if he were not responsible for the death of Vladmir's parents.

"Afraid to hear your Master's name?" Sirius asked.
"Although I can understand you.
His dear followers probably don't love you."

"I…"
Pettrigrew licked his lips, looking at the windows, then the door.
"I don't know what you are talking about, Sirius…"

"You know Peter, I have spent twelve years in Azkaban," Sirius smiled.
"I know you are not hiding from me, but from the other Death Eaters.
In their eyes, you betrayed them because you are responsbile for their Master's fall…
Poor Peter, what a shame so many Death Eaters never went to prison!"

Remus Lupin was astounded by the words he heard.
He had seen Sirius Black's name briefly appear on the Marauder's Map before disappearing in the tunnel.
His blood boiled, and his anger took over logic, so he left to find his friends' murderer.
He would never have expected the situation turning that way.

"I…" Peter started.

"Tsk…
Slightly more, and he's gonna soil his pants," Kevin mocked him.
`Sasssly, are you hungry?`

Pettigrew's scream of abject horror was memorable when he heard the Ravenclaw talk to the huge sleepy serpent, whi lazily opened his eyes when she heard Kevin.
Even the two adults gulped.
Remus had heard about the young Entwhislte's gift through the other Professors, especially since he was Muggle-Born, which defied all expectations around the hereditary nature of Parsletongue.
But knowing and seeing were vastly different things.
As for Sirius, he was not in the know, so he squinted, wary.
Parsletongue was hereditary, the kid could not be a Muggle-Born!

`I don't like missse,` the Basilisk answered.
And the ipressive snake calmly returned towards the Chamber of Secrets, all danger being mitigated.

"He… he…" the rat Animagus stuttered, falling to the ground, trying to get as far away from the young man with glacial blue eyes.
He hit Hermione, who gave him a similarly cold gaze.

"Don't tuch me," she said, pushing him away with her foot, a haughty attitude that surprised Remus Lupin once more.

"You betrayed the Potters," Kevin whispered while giving him an affable smile, the hissing sonorities of Parsletongue still in his voice.
Approaching him, he slowly kneeled in front of him, his face a few centimetre in front of Pettegrew's face, who was shining from sweat.
"You were their Secret Keeper," Kevin continued.
"The man who held their lives in his hands."

"No…"

"You stink of lies," Kevin whispered.
"And I _despise_ liars."

The man, to everyone's disgust, sobbed incontrollably in front of him, which made quite the pityful spectacle.

"No pride," Draco mumbled.

"No courage," Neville sighed.

Hermione was the only one to see the new danger coming from outside.
The ray of moonlight that had just appeared had gone between the old planks that slightly blocked the windows and hit Remus Lupin right in the face.
The Professor started to shake.

"Run!" Hermione suddenly yelled.
"He still hasn't drunk his potion!
He's gonna become dangerous!"

Vladmir and Sirius swore as Peter Pettigrew used the confusion to flee.

"Sirius, stay with Lupin!
Mione, you too!" Vladmir ordered.

"No, it's too dangerous, run Hermione!" the fugitive groaned as the head of their Defence Against the Dark arts Professor was growing longer and dreaful crack could be heard.
The moment the wolf finally emerged, Sirius transformed and jumped to its neck to get it away from Hermione, who was frozen in fear.

"Dray, Nev, go back to the castle while he holds Lupin back and tell Katya.
Hermione, Kevin!"

The Hogwards students did not try to discuss their friend's orders, while the Animagus and the werewolf started to fight.
Neville and Draco ran towards the castle, while Hermione and Kevin turned to chase the rat with Vladmir.

Behind them, the growls and fight noises slowly grew more silent, and when they finally reached the exit of the Shrieking Shack, Vladmir screated in anger.

Below, Hogsmeade village was dimly lit, and it was absolutely impossible to find Pettigrew.

"Hermione, do you have your Time Turner?"

"I do," the young woman agreed.

"If we use it now, can we catch Pettigrew the moment he leaves the Shrieking Shack?"

"We can," Hermione answered, getting a small hourglass from under her blouse.

"Hey," Kevin suddenly whispered, observing the mist that came out of his mouth, "don't you think it's cold for June?"

"Dementors," Vladmir immediately whispered, recognizing the icy sensation in his core, and his senses fogging over.

"They are supposed to guard the outskirts of the school!"

"The Shrieking Shack is right outside the domain," Vladmir grimaced as he grew increasingly pale, memories invading his mind despite his powerful Occlumency shields.
"There!
Merlin, how did they come so fast?"

The two students turned towards where Vladmir pointed, and they saw the dozen hooded figures that came towards them.

"What?" Kevin whispered, as pale as his friend.
"Why are there so many?"

"I don't know," Hermione whispered, the only one not bothered by the presence of Azkaban's guardians.
She hesitated for a few seconds, and took our her wand, the incantation Vladmir was learning with the Defence Against the Dark Arts Professor in her mind.

_"Exepecto Patronum!_" Vladmir screamed, trying to think of his joy when he arrived in second place at the Flightracing event his wnter.

He had managed to produce a dense mist wiht Lupin, but now, only a slight fod came out of his wand.
He clung onto the memory, but it slowly came undone replaced by blood on blonde hair, an atrociously mutilated corpse, screams from a woman, a green light…

_"Expecto Patronum!_" Hermione yelled, a fine mist appearing in front of her.
Horrifyingly, the Dementors simply ignored it and went around her.

"Think about a happy memory!" the Russian screamed to Kevin before whimpering, vanquished by his own memories.
He let himself fal to the ground, silent tears dripping fown his cheeks as the worst moments of his life came back to the surface in full force.

Kevin stepped in front of his friend, his eyes shining with determination.
He remembered the moment he first met Vladmir, the way he had accepted him.
They joy to be invited for the first time of his life when he went to St-Petersburg…
He raised his wand, the proud smile that Vladmir had shown the first time he had managed to talk to Sasha strng in his mind.

_"Expecto Patronum!"_

An opaque mist appeared in front of them, separating them from the Dementors.
However, this mist could not hide the horrible sight.
The Dementors were still pushing forward, and he saw what their faces were like.
At the sight of the necrotized skin, the empty eye sockets, the Ravenclaw's focus faltered, and his Patronus charm disappeared.

"No, please," he whispered, taking his jead between his hands, as memories of his parents' neglect, came back in his mind, as well as his uncle's beatings, the contempt from his brothers⋅
"Not Vlad…
PLease, not him.
Not Vladmir!"

_"Expecto Patronum!"_ the young Gryffindor screamed again, terrified when she saw Kevin, shaking and deathly pale, stand up again to protect Vladmir.
"Noooo!"

She was powerless to stop the dozen Dementors surround her friends.
Vladmir was about to faint, and she could see that Kevin was not too far either, despite all his willpower.

"No!"

She ran towards her friends, understanding that she would not be able to produce a Patronus, not without training, and she covered her friends with her body.

"Leave!" she screamed at the Dementors.

At her order, the Azkaban guardians froze for a fraction of a second, before approaching again.

"LEAVE THEM!"

The moment one of the Dementors reached out its scab-covered hand towards her, a peaceful sensation overcame her, and she was speechaless when she saw three small shining snakes appear.
Familiar snakes…

The Dementors quickly went away, chased out by the two reptiles, who did not hesitate to bite hard or strangle the Creatures.

"Vlad, Kev?" Hermone whispered, softly shaking her still prostrate friends.

Seeing they were not reacting, the young witch rummaged through her pockets to take chocolate our, then unscrupulously slapped the two Ravenclaws.
They fortunately moved, and as they both opened their mouths to protest against her manners, she shoved a piece of chocolate in their hands.

"Eat, we have a rat to catch!"

"Did you do it?"

"I didn't," the young witch said with an enigmatic smile.
"You'll see!"

Vladmir straightened up, still incredibly pale, slowly followed by Kevin.
Without hesitation, the latter embraced Hermione and burrowed his face into her neck.

"Wha…?" she started.

"Shush Mione," the Ravenclaw mumbled.
"Your presence is comforting…"

He stayed in that position for a few seconds, and when he finally freed his friend, she couldn't help but notice that he looked way better.
With a sigh, she turned towards Vlad and took the chain of the Time Turner out.

"Both of you come here," she ordered with a smile.

"Yes, O Mistress of Time!" Kevin joked as he let her put the golden chain around his neck, before Vlad followed.

"Ready?
It's gonna be uncomfortable, but it's normal," she said before turning the hourglass once.

Indeed, both Ravenclaws felt like the ground disappeared under their feet and that they flew at a dizzying speed.
It was a strange mix between a Portkey and the Floo Network, with colours flying in front of their eyes.

As a result, when it stopped, Kevin had to grab on to Vladmir to avoid falling, while the latter stumbled.

"We have 15 minutes before Pettigrew leave from in here," Hermione whispered, pointing towards the entrance to the Shrieking Shack.

Fifteen minutes that they spent attentively waiting, trying not to think about the mass of Dementors who would come.
To try and fight the anxiety, they parcticed the Patronus Charm, trying to find their best memories.

`Hey Vlad, do you think the snakes were our Patronuses?` Kevin eventually asked.

`Probably.`

`Why can't Hermione manage to create a Patronus?` Kevin asked later, calmly sitting down on a rock.
They had a perfect view of the entrace, without even talking about the detection spells that Vladmir had put up.

`Her magic is fundamentally Dark.`

`She is a Licorine.`"

`Both are not incompatible.
Morgan was a true Dark Mage who used animal sacrifices.
Circe was not much better.`

`I though the blessing only was available to the purest and Lightest women.`

`Pure, indeed.
Pure soul, pure heart, pure body.
Not necessarily Light, though…`

`I…`

Vladmir looked at Hermione, who sighed while trying to cast the spell.
The only thing she could manage was a hazy mist, and it was visibly strarting to frustrate her.

`Hermione never had murderous intentions.
She has never known true hate.
She gets angry, indeed.
She has quite the temper when she shows it, indeed.
She can plan vengeance, indeed.
However, she never truly wanted to hurt any one.
She always forgives a few hours later, time enough to calm down and think rationally.`

`Hence soul and heart purity…
What about the body?`

Vladmir game him a mocking smile, and Kevin blushed slightly as he looked at their friend.
At the same time, the alarms the Gemini set up discreetly rang.

They immediately stood up and Kevin spotted the thin rat.

_"Stupefy!"_

_"Accio Pettigrew!"_

The rat, who was hit by the dark red ray, jumped before pulled towards Hermione.
Vladmir caught it mid-flight and put it in his pocket.

"Quickly, hide!" the young woman suddently whispered while pushing her friends.

"But…"

"What?"

"Shush!" she groaned, casting a Silencing Charm on them.
She got two daggers-inducing stared, but Hermione simply put her figer on her lips to keep them silent.
The two Ravenclaws turned towards where she pointed, towards the entrance of the Shrieking Shack.

"Time Turner 101… never been seen by yourself!"

Indeed, their past selves had just come out of the ruined house.
Kevin held back a chuckle at Vladmir's incredulous look when he saw himself scream in rage.

"Yeah, you're scary," Hermione whispered.
"But you already know that!"

As in their memories, the negative effect of the Dementors did take long to manifest, and Vladmir swore when he heard himself wonder about how quickly they could act.

"We were the ones to lure them here," he whispered.
"We've been here for 15 minutes.
Long enough to be detected.

"Why aren't they targetting us?" Hermione wailed while the past Kevin was starting to whimper and do his best to protect Vladmir.

"They are easier targets than we are, completely exposed, while we are partially protected by the thicket," the Russian whispered.

"It also explained why they did not feel as bad as in their first meeting.

"Merlin, Vlad, we… they are not well…"

Hermione screamed at the Dementors to get them to leave, protecting her friends with her body, but apart from a little hestitation, the magical creatures did not react and conitnued slowly creeping towards their prey.

Kevin swore and took out his wand.
He closed his eye, thinking about he appeased he felt while formulating his oath.
The pain, then the joy to know he was magically linked to his sould brother…

_"Expecto patronum,"_ he whispered.

Two bright white snakes sprang out of his wand.
Two snakes so similar to his familiars that Kevin, speechless, could only look in wonder how Cassson and Casssa attacked the Dementors to same them from a fatal kiss at the last second.

"Wow…"

"Thanks Mione," Kevin chuckled as he heard his friend's exclamation.
Vladmir simply nodded, thinking the same as the Gryffindor.
To see the Dementors flee like Merlin himself was pursuing them was deeply satisfying.

As the two Patronuses disappeared, Vladmir turned to his friends.

"Where are we going now?" Hermione asked.

"What have you planned for him?" Kevin added, pointed to Vladmir's pockets.

"Simply asking a few questions to a traitor, the Russian whispered in a quite unsettling cold voice.

"Let's go to the school, then," Kevin declared enthusiastically, making sure their past selves had disappeared.

"Kev…"

The Ravenclaw stopped, his foot on the only safe step, and gave her a perplxed look.

"Do you remember that there is a werewolf in the Shack?"

Kevin looked at Hermione, then at the doorknob he had in his hand, then at his friends again.

"Hermione could try to calm him down, but let's avoid this kind of experience right now," Vladmir continued.

"I had forgotten," he mumbled, embarassed, climbing back down the stairs towards Vladmir and Hermione.
The former sniggered in response, while the latter roller her eyes, praying Merlin on the Ravenclaws' so-called intelligence.

After consulting the Marauder's Map, they were surprise to see that while the passage to the Shrieking Shack was not fully drawn, another one was similard, but precisely explained where the exit was: Honeydukes…

The three students silently walked towards the Hogsmeade village, which a few lanterns showed the existence of in the moonlight, planning to illegally enter the candy shop to return to the school.

In this perilous enterprise‑they would break and enter into a wizarding house, something that was not recommended if you wanted to keep your freedom and your life‑the three students had the edge on two poinds.
First, no wizard or witch would walk outside at night, now while it was the wolves' night.
Second, Vladmir was with them.
Even if he did not specialize in burglary, the young Russian knew a few basic things, like all members of the Mirage COurt.

The first thing in their plan was to Disillusion themselves.
Getting caught and recognised by a random wizards who was not sleeping was out of the question.

Second, they had to find the staff entrance, the one that was on secondary alleys and not the main street.
For the same reason, especially since the magic they would do produced revealing lights.
They had to avoid getting caught to avoid being expelled.

Third, and not the least, was to deactivate all the magical alarms on the door.
Fortunately, Vladmir knew most detection charms, as well as quite a few disreputable hexes to counter alarms.

So they relatively easily traversed the shop to get to the cave.

"Kevin, put that back!" Hermione suddenly hissed.

The Muggleborn raised an eyebrow and stuck his tongue out, eating a Chocolate frog.

"I put a Sickle in the till," the Ravenclaw sighed as the young woman looked daggers at him.

"There weren't any alarms?" Vladmir wondered as he squinted his eyes, wary."

"Appartently n…
Wooops!"

Vladmir swore as an alarm rang out above them.
Something fell almost immediately, and a light appeared up the stairs.

"Well done, idiot!" Hermione groaned, slapping Kevin on the back of his head.

"Idiot", Vladmir grumbled, imitating her.

_"Accio_ hairs from Hermione Granger, Vladmir Kemenov, and Kevin Entwhistle," Kevin sighed, rubbing the back of his head.
_"Incendio!_"

He quickly destroyed the evidence the Aurors could find.
Vladmir had explained to them that while some Muggle techniques were not used, like fingerprints and DNA, wizards sometimes assembled hairs or other organic materials to test them with Polyjuice.
The idea was to identify the individuals, to later interrogate them with Veritaserum.
It was rarely used for petty theft, especially in a place with as much traffic as a candy shop near the wizarding school, but you never knew…

"Good catch," Vlad sighed, pushing the two Muggle-Borns towards the cellar.
Right on time, because the moment he closed the door, he could hear the owner quickly climb down the stairs.

'He is quicker than average', the Russian thought whiel carefully observing his surroundings.
A thief had five minutes on average to leave the premises after an alarm triggered.
Flume, the shop owner, had reacted in only three…

"There!" Kevin suddenly pointed to a zone where the layer of dust as thinner.
In a few seconds, Vlamdir had uncovered the trapdoor that lead to the secret passage and the three students had disappeared, while Flume contacted the Aurors one floor up.

When they finally got back to the HQ, after avoiding the new caretaker, they met with the whole Alliance, as well as Katya, Lucius, and Sergei.

"Sirius hasn't come back?" Vlamdir wondered, letting himself fall on a cushion while Katya cast a cleaning spell on them, removing the spider webs and the dust that covered them.

"Sirius Black is here?" Cedric noted.
"That's risky…"

"The hound wanted to bite the rodent," Luna said dreamily.
"He got bitten instead.

"Is he okay?" Lucius worried.

"You are worrying about Black, now?" Severus seemed surprised as he looked up from his eternal papers.

Lord Malfoy mumbled a few things about mutts without manners in response.

"He is crying," Luna added with a touch of sadness.

"Serves him well," Vladmir grumbled.
"He should never have come!
What a stupid idea, really!"

"Do you have Pettigrew?"

Vladmir took the unconscious rat out of his pocket, holding it by the tip of his tail with apparent disgust.
Katya's eyes became as cold as ice and everyone instictively moved away from the two Russians.

"Well, I think it's time to discover the Hogwarts Dungeons, isn't it?" Severus sniggered, rubbing his hands together.
He had always hated Pettigrew, at least as much as the other Marauders.
At least James, Sirius, and Remus had some panache and a rock solid audacity, but Peter…
He was a pure coward, the thing the Potions Master hated the most.

"There are dungeons in the school?
Real ones?" Neville wondered out loud.

"And even catacombs," the Head of Slytherin acquiesced.

The Potions Master's and the vampire's smiles were were similar, and the Weasley twins looked at each other, wondering if Professor Prince did not have some kind of vampiric blood, like some rumours said.

"Wait…"

"… catacombs?" his brother continued with wide eyes.

"Where do you thing the Founders are buried?" Severus asked, amused.

"I would have thought in a cemetary," Draco admitted, after he had simply focused on warily staring at the rat in Vladmir's hands.

"They are in the Founders' Crypt, under the Great Hall."

"I though the kitchens were underneath the Great Hall?" Cedric noted, quickly supported by the Weasley twins, who knew that place well.

"Even lower."

"Why don't those places appear on the school's maps?" Hermione asked, as she remembered the school plans that had allowed her and Kevin to create the giant Map in the HQ.

"For safety reasons…"

The existence of the lower floors was one of the best kept secrets of the school.
Hogwarts had not always been a place of knowledge.
For decades, the huge castle had been a seignorial possession, before the Founders bought the domain to make a school.
Even afterwards, as time passed, Hogwarts had periodically taken back a military function during the many conflicts that punctuated the centuries.

This was the reason why Hogwarts was one of the safest schools in the world.
Its magical defences had a millenium to be developped and perfected.
Under a competent Headmaster, who was able to properly use the protections, the school was impregnable.

And in the more hypotherical case where the school finally fell, the underground floors of the castle were able to house nearly a thousand people and allow them to flee into the adjacent grottos while the Founders' wrath protected them.

Because the school's motto was not just mere words.
_Draco dormiens nunqua titillandus_…
The Founders' crypt not only housed the remains of the famous Founders, but also Hogwarts' remains.
Hogwarts, the Founders' protecting familiar.
Hogwarts, the dragon that slept an enchanted sleep under their feet.
Hogwarts, that a Headmaster or Deputy could call in exchange for their life to protect the students, as they had vowed when taken up their duties.

Thus, a few floors lower and a few minutes later, a small group used the true Dungeons of the school, still not knowing the sleeping dragon was there.

"Why did you betray my parents and Sirius?" Vladmir slowly asked as the traitor, solidly attached to a metal table, was shaking under Katya's Lucius's and Vladmir's gazes.

Peter Pettigrew moaned and shook his head.
Sergei stepped out of the shadows, under his most inhuman form.
He smiled when Pettigrew screamed in terror and slowly, he unsheated his claws to follow the limits of the Dark Mark tatooed on Pettigrew's right arm.
He pushed his claws on on skin just enough to make their prisonner yell out in pain, but not enough to breach anything other than the epidermis.

"You should definitely answer," Katya sighed.

"Indeed, Sergei is quite the gifted torturer," Lucius said with a false sadness.
"Even Voldemort is a beginner compared to him.
Although Sergei has quite a few centuries of experience more than him."

"And he's the one who taught everything to Vlad.
No, Vlad Tepes, also known as Dracula," Katya added with a sadistic smaile when Peter looked at Vladmir.

"And you know the best part?" Sergei asked calmly as he leaned over the crying man.
"During the trial, you won't be able to talk about our little… meeting."

"Tri… trial?" Pettigrew whimpered.

"Of course, you see, my Godfather's name must be cleared.
"I would have let you bleed out after having tortured you in the worst way…
But for him to be finally free, I need you, alive.
So… why did you betray us?"

"You… it is… impossible to…"

"Impossible to refuse Voldemort anything?
Sirius did it, Peter.
My father did it, and I did it two years ago…
And I am still alive!"

"He's just a coward," Sergei whispered with contempt, still absentmidedly tearing the man's arm.
"He's looking for the most powerful in a clan for his own protection.
In Hogwarts, it was the Marauders.
Then, the Death Eaters."

"Try not to rip him apart, or we'll have to heal him afterwards…"

Sergei, who was distractedly playing with a piece of skin to while delighting in the small yelps of pain of the prisonner, grimaced in disappointment, but obeyed.

For Lucius, the differences between the social Sergei and the one in front of him were obvious, but quite shocking.
He knew that the vampired, the true one, was the one that basked in the sudffering of others, enjoying the cries of pain as Sergei did now.
It was a normal thing…
Vampires were Dark creatures, who showed a civilized face to the wizards and witches, but they were still fundamentally dangerous and mean to their enemies.

Turning to Vlamdir, he noticed that he showed a sombre faced.
The Ravenclaw only felt disgust for the coward in front of them.
So much disgust that he did not even want revenge against him any more.
His true target was Voldemort, not the miserable rat in front of him.
Voldemort and Dumbeldore.

As Sergei stood up, the young man leaned towards Pettigrew, who shivered at the student's terrifying eyes.

"Do you know where Albus Dumbledore is?"

"N…
Wait!
Don't…
He is hiding," Pettigrew screamed as Vlamdir pointed his wand to his tomach.
"He is hiding, it's… it's all I know!"

"We know that, my question is: where?"

"I don't know!
He's always been a powerful wizard!
They say that even when he was young, with Grindelwald…"

Young…
Sergei's brain disconnected as he remembered a person at the Saturnalia ball.

"Lucius…
What did Dumbledore looked like when he was young?"

The Malfoy patriarch turned away from the pityful spectacle to focus on the concerned vampire.

"A redhead with shining blue eyes…"

Lucius fell silent as an image of a young Albus Dumbledore appeared in front of him, taken from the one of the vampire's memories.

"Him?"

"Him."

Sergei turned to Katya.
The witch was waiting for her friend to explain himself, worry visible in her hazel eyes.
She knew the vampire well enough to recognised his every expression, and worry was visibly mixed with anger.

**"Katya… he was at Augusta's ball this winter…
With Valerius Dominius…"**

The magical explision took them by surprise and only Sergei's quick reflexes allowed Peter Pettigrew to live, which would have been a deserved but undesirable death for now…
Not while he was not judged.

**"Vlamdir Vassilievitch!"** katya hissed, htreatening.

**"Sorry,**" he whispered, before continuing with more venom.
**"This son of a bitch was at the Saturnalia?"**

**"With Valerius,"** Sergei grumbled.

Katya could not help but sigh.
The night was far from over.
Knowing the animosity between the two chiefs of Vampire Clans, and Vladmir's hatred of Dumbledore, they would create a twisted plan only they could conceive.
But before taking care of her small family, she had a parcel to deliver.

"Lucius?"

Katya smiled when she saw her lover look with amusement at the twi Russians grumbling Slavic insults at the same time, confabulating, probably on the best methods of torture for their respective ennemies.
But she could also see worry in his grey eyes, which he manifested by softly passing an arm over her shoulders.

"Yes, dear?" the Lord eventually said.

"Could you drop Pettigrew in Amelia's office?"
