## Chapter 28: Expelled?

Vladmir was probably cursed.
He only saw this explanation to justify this string of bad luck that started some time before.
After finding Mrs. Norris, of course the next one on the Heir of Slytherin's list was this particular student.

The young Russian cursed in his native language, breathing in deeply, before opening his eyes to look at the corpses...
Well, corpses...
Justin Finch-Fletchley was undeniably petrified, a surprised look in his face, but how could a ghost be affected, Merlin only knew.
It was supposed to be dead, and thus not subject to the magical rules of this world!

Vladmir rubbed his forehead.
The simplest thing to do was flee, he decided.
He had threatened Justin in front of witnesses, and was already suspected to be a Dark Mage.
He was the perfect culprit.
Indeed, the simplest thing was to flee.

He was about to leave the corridor, when a sly voice started cackle near him, taking him by surprise.

"Well, well, well, little Kiki, you taking a walk?
Were are your lackeys?"

Vladmir did not try to understand.
Between the insult- but why Kiki?- and the proximity of his counterpart, he instinctively reacted and turned, taking his wand out.
His target quickly turned in the air, and suspiciously looked at the dark spot on the wall, where the Ravenclaw's spell had hit the wall.

"Dark Magic, little snake?" the poltergeist whispered.
"It's highly forbidden in the school.
You're trying to get expelled, Kiki Kemeny..."

"Pevees..."

Vladmir's hoarse voice was scary.
The Russian had nothing against the school's poltergeist.
Until now, he had never been its target, and Vlad alway liked seeing Peeves prank other students.
But now, that the poltergeist had frozen in the air, seeing the two petrified beings, trouble was coming.

Vladmir pinched the bridge of his nose and sighed, forecasting what would happend next. And it did not take long...

"ATTACK, ATTACK IN THE CORRIDORS! NO LIVING BEGIN, NO GHOST IS SAFE! ATTACK IN THE CORRIDORS!"

The poltergeist had a really loud voice, and he sudenly heard chairs and doors noises coming from the neighbouring corridors.
Vladmir turned away and sighed again when he crossed a light blue gaze than shone with malice.
He definitely wwas cursed.
hat did he do in a previous life to get this karma?

"Headmaster, I admit that I seem to be the culprit, but..."

"Mr. Kemenov, my office, now!"

Vladmir's face when expressionless as he saw Albus Dumbledore and Minerva McGonagall face him, the latter pointing her wand menacingly.
He straightened up a bit, and looked daggers at the professors.
Since hey wanted to pin him as the cultrpit, he would play his cards right to annoy the Headmaster as much as possible.

Students and professors were starting to walk near them.
Fortunately, only a few classrooms were in reach of Peeves' voic, but all the school would know before lunch.
Vladmir tilted his head and frowned, observing the adults in front of him.
Let's see what his schoolmates would think of theis piece of news...

"Since this summer, I have a ruling of the Wizengammot preventing your from approaching me outside of classes without my guardian or someone duly appointed by her," Vladmir coldly declared.

An exasperated glow furtively appreared behind the half-moon classes of Professor Dumbledore, while the Deputy Heasmistress pinched her lips.
Whispers rose up among the fifth-year Slytherin students in Runes classes, and the Ravenclaw first-years in Transfiguration.

"We will call for Mrs. Kemenov immediately," the Headmaster declared.
"Minerva, please ask for the presence of all Heads of House."

Vladmir clenched his teeth, hiding his rage behind his mask, as the Head of Gryffindor turned away.
Even the young Russian's eyes showed no emotion, his mask prefectly in place.
He finally raised his head to look at the Headmaster defiantly.
He only knew one situation where all the Heads of House and a representative of the child were needed.

A disciplinary hearing.

Dumbledore lost himself once more in the glacial eyes of the young Russian student, and muzzled his instinct that told him that the last time he had seen this gaze, he had lost all his ministerial responsibilities.

"Vlad!" Neville's voice made him turn his head, and his friends froze, still out of breath, following a smiling Luna.
She had chosen to fetch them, guessing that Vladmir would be in trouble.
They had all seen the Russian angry, but from his total absence of emotion and his cold eyes, he had jsut reached a higher level.
Vladmir Vassilievitch Kemenov was beside himself.

"Please go back to your classrooms," the old mage ordered, ignoring the suddenly cold temperature in the corridor.

"Listen to him, I will keep you in the know," Vlad said in a lifeless voice.

Hermione, crying, launched herself into his arms and hugged him close.
She seemed to have guess that real trouble awaited him.
Despite his anger, Vladmir held back a smiled, and hugged her back, as something fell into his pocket.
Hermione seemed to have finished the Galleon prototypes.

Kevin simply put his hand on his shoulder and looked daggers at the Headmaster, while the two Pure-Bloods assured him of their support.
Behind Dumbledre, Draco mimed his father's name and more than ambiguous gesture towards the Headmaster.
Although Vlad doubted Lucius would kill Albus Dumbledore, he would certainly make the old's mage life as miserable as possible, with his son's blessing.

Vladmir thus followed the school's Headmaster to his office, and raised an eyebrow in contempt when he hear "Sherbet Lemon" used as the password.
If he remembered correctly, last year's password was also candy.
And according to the Potions Master, Albus Dumbledore had a soft spot for all types of candy.
In some world, he would have one of those Muggle maladies like diabetes, causing him a quick death by stroke or, even better, a heart attack...

A soft quaver welcomed him, perching on his shoulder, asking for pets.
Vlad mechanically obeyed, while the bird cooed and he observed all four Heads of House already in the office.
They had come quite quickly.
McGonagall seemed at ease, Sprout was wondering why an exceptional summon happened, Flitwick seemed furious to see one of his students accused, especially one of his protégés, and Snape... Snape had simply raised an eyebrow that simply asked something like 'you dunderhead, what have you done this time to get into this?'

'Don't forget about me, will you?'

Vladmir held back a smile when the old hat appeared in his mind.
He looked for Andre's spot on the shelves and eventually spotted him behind Snape, making small movements to catch his attention.

'Do you know what fate awaits me?'

'I do, but knowing you, you'll appreciate it.
You won't say no to one more week of holidays, will you?'

Vladmir could nearly see the Sorting Hat's wink.

'As for our business, don't worry, Fawkes told me he agreed to shuttle you between Russian and the HQ when you need to see them or they ask to see you.'

'I love you both.'

And Vladmir redoubled his attention on the phoenix, who cooed even more, to inderectly thank him.
The Transfigration professor was surprised to see the phoenix step don from the Russian' shoulder to sprawl in his arms, cheeping from joy.
The young Ravenclaw seemed to know what to so, despite the abnormal behaviour of the bird, and started to scratch Fawkes' downy chest feathers.
She composed herself, slightly shaking her head.

"Mrs. Kemenov should arrive shortly," she announced.

"Miss, I was never married," said a cold voice that made the Head of Gryffindor jump.
In front of the massive chimney, Katya held herself perfectly straight, wearing a sumptuous dress that showed her social rank and her wealth.

"The least one can do is address people correctly," a second person added as they stepped out of the chimney, as Katya stepped aside to let them in.

"Lucius? You are not invited to..."

"I am still the chair of the Board of Governors of Hogwarts, Albus, and it happens that Lady Kemenov and myself were in a business meeting when a message arived from the school," the Lord groaned, before nodding at everyone.
"Ladies, Gentlemen."

The meeting seemed to be important, because Lucius also wore a formal dress.
A gala reception, Vladmir guessed, looking a critical look at the Lord's perfectly adjusted grey silk costume on a brocarde jacket and a richly ornamented parade cape, before he remembered an important meeting for the Mirage Court.

The old mage pulled himself together quickly from the Lord's unexpected presence, and made another seat appear.
Several people pulled a face, noting the arrangement of the seats, that reminded them too much of a trial.
Albus Dumbledore seemed to sit on a throne in his Headmaster's seat, surrounded by his Heads of House, and faced Vladmir and Katya.
Lucius did not hesitate and rejected the offered seat outright to seat at the boy's left.
He had rarely seend the young heir, and was impressed by both Kemenovs' perfect mastery of themselves.
Two ice statues waiting for the storm.

"Very well, I asked for your presence to discuss the case of Mr. Vladmir Kemenov," the Headmaster started.
"If Dark Magic spell he regularly used are tolerated because of his nationality, we have to worry about Mr. Kemenov's repeated presence on the locations of the unexplained attacks."

"Do I have to understand that you are accusing my godson of the aggression of his classmates?" Katya slowly asked.

"He is only suspected," Minerva McGonagall contracted her.

"You are playing on words, it is basically the same," Katya noted, putting a hand on Vlad's shoulder.

The young Russian felt a pressure and unnoticably sighed and nodded.
Katya was silently asking him to let her lead the conversation and to intervene as little as possible.

Katya thus plunged her dark gaze into the Headmaster shining blue, and raised her shiled when she felt something brush against her defences.
She gave her a powerful mental slap, before turning to Lucius, ignoring the angry spark in the eyes of the man, who had paled after the matriarch's discreet retaliation.

"Lucius, you know the rules of Hogwarts better than I do.
Is this a disciplinary hearing?"

"It is indeed.
Do you have any proof apart from Mr. Kemenov's coincidental presence?"

"Justin Finch-Fletchey had an altercation with this young boy in the entry hall," Aldbus Dumbledore said, vaguely pointing to Vlamdir, who raised an eyebrow scornfully, but stayed silent.
"This quarrel happened in front of witnesses, and threats were clearly stated.
I will add that his snake threatened him during the duelling club and, strangely, the next day, the young Justin was found petrified."

"I am aware about this quarrel," Lucius intervened.
"Mr. Kemenov defended his fiancée's honour, and you cannot reproach him for that."

"However, threats are reprehensible...
Furthermore, only cats, owls, rats, and toads are allowed, snakes are not, especially venomous spieces," the Transfiguration professor added.
"It is a grave breach of the school's rules, and put his schoolmates in danger."

Katya observed Flitwick and Sprout nod in bad grace.
They seemed outraged by this trial parody, but Sasha's presence was indeed forbidden.
It was only bad luck that revealed the small ice viper's presence...
Draco had cast a Snake Summons Spell, spell that summonned the closest snake to the caster...
Because of bad luck, it was Sasha...

"I had no reason to attack Mrs. Norris, nor Colin Crivey," Vladmir then said.

"Please, Mr. Kemenov," Albus said with a smile, "young Colin's fascination for the Saviour was known in all of Gryffindor tower.
Your friends told you about it, and it angered you.
Especially because he took hundreds of pictures of you, since the start of the year."

Vladmir frowned, a surprised expression passing on his eyes, before regaining his composure.
He remembered the small Gryffindor during the Sorting Ceremony, with his keen eye, but he had never seen him around himself.
He was nearly invisible...
He calmly explained to the people in the room that he did not know, and reraised the point about Mrs. Norris.

"The first victim was a trial run, it's easier on an animal..."

"Are you talking from experience?" Katya groaned, staring at the old woman.
"Or do you feel targetted because your Animagus form is merely a cat?"

The Hogwarts' witch turned red at the insult, and opened her mouth, but Katya raise a hand with authority, looking the woman up and down.

"It was not really a question, madam.
I do not expect an answer from a... woman like you.
As for yourself, Mr. Dumbledore, please continue with your pseudo disciplinary hearing.
No reason you brought up until now is valid to incriminate my nephew, apart from Sasha's presence."

"However, suspicions are here.
Furthermore, the Hogwarts library posesses a quite unique book.
Merlin's book of bloodlines.
Your nephew is the heir of Salazard Slythrin by right of conquest."

Vladmir cursed Hermione, who had insisted to bring back the book to the library to free Kevin from accusations of theft.
She had unwillingly given the Headmaster ammunition.

"For all those reasons, I temporarily expel Vladmir Kemenov until further proof is discovered," Albus Dumbledore concluded with a smile.

"You the real one responsible for this is discovered", Lucius lashed out.
"However, if Mr. Kemenov is not linked to this case, I hope for your sake that he will get compensation for the social, moral and school damage being expelled will bring to him."

"I am protecting my school as best as I can, Lucius.
However, if it happens that Mr. Kemenov is not linked to this case, he will be allowed to go back to class.
In the meantime, he is expelled with immediate effect."

"You are not the only one to decide!" Katya took offence.

"To tell you the truth, he is," Lucius sighed.
"The Board of Governors voted yesterday to give the Headmaster full powers to protect Hogwarts from the threat."

Katya saw red, understanding that her nephew was simlpy expelled by a unilateral decision.

She approached the desk with a feline gait and whispered to the old wizard with a honeyed voice.

"Are you aware that your only remaining position is this?
Because you will not keep it for long, pseudo-mage."

"I have been recognised as a mage for decades," the Headmaster answered with a smile.
"And you do not have the authority to fire me.
Only the Board of Governors can."

"Theodore Nott, Amelia Bones, and Damocles Rowle are in the Board, as are the Malfoys and Longbottoms," Katya responded sardonically.
"Also remember I am still a Potter by blood, even if I do not bear the name, as is Vladmir.
You have two votes out of fifteen, I already have five.
Destitution is only a majority vote, and I will get you sacked."

Katya straightened up and turned to Vladmir, motioning him to follow her.
The young Russian only looked the old man up and down for a few seconds, before looking at the other Heads of House, noting astonishment and disbelief on Flitwick's and Sprout's faces.

"Albus, do you know the difference between the mage and a wizard?" Lucius sofly asked, lookinga the not so venerable Hogwarts Headmaster after the door had slammed after the Kemenovs.

"Power," the old man immediately answered, getting a disappointed sighed from the Lord.

And to say that Dumbledores were old an Pure-Blood family, even without a title...
Truly, more and more traditions and knowledge get lost each generation.

"Power is certainly part of it, but let me tell you how you are wrong.
The average wizard has a source of internal magic that is his won, but cannot use in its entirety.
Conversely, a mage can fully use his internal magic.
He has attained what we call magical penitude.
This state allows one to do numerous things, including not having physical after-effects from using all their magic, contrary to an average wizard who will be tired and weakened after casting a powerful spell."

"I don't see what this has to do with Mr. Kemenov being sent down," Minerva McGonagal cut him, before being rebuffed by Professor Sprout, who was deeply interested in the explanations.

"PLease let me finish, Professor," Lucius Malfoy sighed.
"A true mage is also a wizard who master the ancient magic.
Not only will he be able to use his own magic, but also from the surrounding magic.
He thus has an infite source of magic.
Do you master this ancient magic, Headmaster?"

All wizards and witches saw the sudden look the Headmaster gave Severus at the mention of ancient magic, making the Potions Master frown.

"I don't," the old wizard said.

"However, your former lover, Grindelwald, knew it and, more importantly, used it, as did Voldemort.
They had the title of Dark Mage for this reason, contrary to you, who basks in your status as Light Mage, although you only use your internal magic."

Dumbledore seemed to have been smacked, and he looked at the Lord warily.

"What is your point?"

"The Kemenovs are a family of mages.
You made an enemy of one of the most powerful lines in Europe."

"They are nothing compared to our Five Families," Minerva suddenly intervened.

"The Five Families?" Snape picked up with a surprise smirk.
"Who are they?"

Lucius held back a mocking sneer, and only smiled lightly.
A smile that could pass as condescending for anyone who did not know him.
Snape deserved to be Head of Slytherin.
He took made the most of the moment to make the old wizard talk, without seeming to be involved.

"Well, they are the five oldest magical families in England, the highest in the aristocracy.
If I remember correctly, they all have the title of prince," Minerva said, thoughtful, not seeing the furious and supplicant look of her Headmaster friend.

"I did not hear about peinces," Snape said, frowning, "althogh a lot of Pure-Bloods like to brag about their aristocratic status."

"The question is not there," Albus groaned, growing paler.

"But it is, the Five Familes know the ancient magic and are more or less its guardians," Flitwick declared, feeling something was happening.
He only needed to look at his Potions colleague once to see that he seemed to be jubilant, despite his expressionless face.
He was managing to hooking the Headmaster for some reason, and Flitwick wanted to see what that was about.

"Well, the Notts, Bones, and Rowles are quite discreet, the Potters..."

"The Potters are fine, thank you very much, as you might have noticed," Lucius said, amused, responding to McGonagall's uncertain gaze.
The Lors regretted to see the Kemanov matriarch gone, but he promised himself to show her the memory.
She would revel in this quite emotional and information-dense meeting.
Snape was trapping Dumbledore admirably well, with the old Gryffindor harpy's unvolontary help.
It was a good day, after all!

"As for the last family, the Prince line is extinct."

"Prince?" Snape asked, raising an eyebrow.
"As in Eileen Prince?" 

"Indeed," Minerva nodded after a long sigh.
"Unfortunately, the bloodline stopped after her.
Even if the name is lost, her son or daughter would have inherited her titles and the family's fortune, especially since no one can disown a member of the Five Families."

"Albus," Snape suddenly groaned with a threatening voice, looking daggers at the Headmaster, "I think you owe me an explanation."

"Severus?" Flitwick was suddenly alarmed.

Even if his colleague was threatening, he could see satisfaction in his eyes.
His Goblin instinct was screaming that Snape would rush his prey and mortally strike him...
How was the Potions Professor linked to the Five Families?

"What explanation, Severus?" Pomona asked, perplexed.

"My mother was Eileen Prince, and the Headmaster, upon my grandfather's death, told me that I was disowned."

Silence suddenly fel, and Lucius stood up and reajusted his cape, everyone's attention on him.
He had heard enough, and Severus was more than capable to manage the Headmaster by himself.

Lucius turned, and was about to leave himself, when he looked back at the five professors.

"I have to admit I nearly forgot the reason for this revelation.
To get back to the Kemenov line, they are the Russian imperial line, the last descendants of the Romanovs.
It is an open secret in Russia, but strangely, this kind of information doesn't cross the border, even though half the Russian wizards and witches adore their family and half hate them.
The young Vladmir's full title is Successor Tsesarevitch Vladmir Vassilievitch Kemenov, Prince Potter, Prince of Czerna and Duke of Englewton [1].
Thus, he is of equal, if not of higher stature than our Five Families."

Lucius left them there, noting in stupefied looks before leaving.
He allowed himself to laugh only when he reached an empty meeting room.
Indeed, he would show Katya this memory!

<hr>

Meanwhile, Vladmir had reached his common room.
Kevin was waiting for him, sitting on an armchair, Sasha around his neck, and Luna was sitting on the ground in front of him.
They were having a lively discussion, the other Ravenclaws looking at them warily.
Despite the circumstances, Vlad smiled softly, proud of them.
Kevin did not let himself hear the mean comments and the sudden fear of students from his own House.
He had clearly claimed his Muggle-Born status, before sending the ones still doubting his filiations packing.
The argument of Parsletongue being heriditary was the one that annoyed him the most.

Since then, Kevin had been quite alone, but as he had already declared, the young Ravenclaw did not care one bit.
He stayed with his friends and Luna, ignoring the others.
The blue eyes of the Muggle-Born stared at him as he approached them, split between curiosity and worry.

"So, what did the Headmaster want?"

"I am temporarily expelled, as the main suspect in the case of the infamous Heir."

"What?" Kevin cried out, jumping out of his seat.
"He didn't dare!"

"Bah, we'll just say that it good for me, I have research to do, and a few things to attend to."

"Why do you stay?"

Vladmir looked at Luna for a few moments, who had stood up and dustedher perfectly clean robes.
Indeed, why did he stay in this school when any other school would have welcomed him with open arms?
He sighed, putting a strand of blonde hair behind the first year's ear.

"Simply, my friends are here."

A warm smile appeared on Luna's face and she embraced Vladmir quite strongly despite her small frame.
The Russian, not used to effusions of friendship, awkwardly pat her back, realizing that he was a full head taller than her.

"Thank you," Luna whispered.
"And don't forget tomorrow evening!"

Vlamdir laughed as he watched the small girl skipping away.
How, by Merlin, could she know that André had found him undetectable transportation through Fawkes?
Then he turned to pack his things in his friend and roommate's company.

<hr>

Needless to say, Vladmir being expelled one week before the Christmas holidays was definitely a good thing.
As he had told evin, numerous things awaited him in Russia.
First off, a meeting of the most powerful Triads in Europe, to help reform the English Mirage Court.
Normally, he would not have been able to attend, but as he was expelled, he could fulfil his responsibilities.

Neither Katya nor Lucius would have admitted during the disciplinary hearing that their meeting was quite illegal.
Thus Vladmir arrived by Portkey somewhere in France, still wearing his Hogwarts unifor, his suitcase shrunk in his pocket.
The meeting was already in progress, and his late arrival made him the center of attention.

"Please excuse me for being late," he announced to the assembly of seven Triads and five heirs.

Vlad calmly settled down to her aunt's right, looking attentively at the people sitting around the table.
He easily recognised representatives from the French, Romanian, Czech, Portuguese, Irish, Italian and Russian Courts.
They were the most powerful European Courts, with the most expansive influence and commerce networks.

In the middle of all these, Lucius Malfoy was presenting how his reconstruction project was going, clearly and concisely.
According to Katya's last notes, the English Lord had contacted the twelve Master famiies, gotten intelligence on the surviving former members, and the former partners of the Court.
Vladmir, amused, notably heard the Three Broomsticks pub in Hogsmead for alcohol supplies and an illegal gambling room, as well as Florean Fortescue, famous owner of the ice cream parlour on Diagon Alley, specialised in money laundering.

"Do you have names for future members of the Triad?" a skinny blonde with a strong Czech accent asked.

"For now, only one.
Severus Snape.
He is the last member of the Master Prince Family.
We have talked about this for a long time, and he agreed to head the Underground with me."

Vladmir looked at her aunt, surprised, which made Katya smile.
She had know for a while that Lucius was expecting his old friend's help.

"You talk about former members, but well all know that th Courts need new blood," a paunchy smliling man commented with a thick French accent.
"I think we could all send you some young members to infiltrate in good positions and develop the English network."

"To tell you the truth, we won't need this help.
A seconday network is currently emerging in Hogwarts," Lucius said, looking at Vladmir.
"It is under the tutelage of the Russian Heir Kemenov, and is developing correctly.
He has all my trust to consolidate the network."

Gazes turned to Vlad, who stayed expressionless, while railing against his Potions Professor in his mind, who ignored the Unbreakable Vow... but how?

"I told him, kitten," Katya discreetly whispered.

When Vlad had told her that Severus Snape had been welcomed into the Alliance, she had decided to tell Lord Malfoy about this little illegal network in Hogwarts.
She knew her nephew, he would have required a vow to protect the Alliance, and thus Lucius ignored that he would have future members now in Hogwarts.
Vladmir simply nodded, focussing on the meeting.

"Are you not afraid to be exposed?
The tragic end of the Underground in 1973 must not happen again.
Our other channels must be protected, but potions appeared since.
Potions that could compromise the safety of all Courts if the Triad fell once more in the hand of ill-intentionned wizards."

Lucius' face tensed up.

"The traitor's identity is certain.
We will deal with this case internally when the time is right."

Vladmir reflected on this answer for a long time.
Was Narcissa really responsible, and if she was, what would Lucius do?
He would be the first suspect if his wife died.
The meeting ended quickly and Katya was named to help Lucius in his reconstruction work."

To the young Kemenov's great regret, Lucius immediately left once the meeting was finished.
He would have liked to know more about Narcissa Malfoy's implication...
He would have tried to question her aunt on this, but she also cowardly abandonned him wiht a sorry smile in the back alley behind the Kemenov palace.

"What do they all have today?" Vlad sighed in the snowy and badly-lit alley of Saint-Petersburg.

"You are here sooner than expected, Vladmir Kemenov."

Vladmir observed the man on duty walk out of the shadows.
Well, man...
Vladmir smiled at the House Elf in full black uniform.

"I was kindly expelled from my school.
You are on gard duty now, Ubista?"

The House Elf's ears shook has the wide eyes stared at him, defeated.

"What do you want, Highness, my talent is not fully appreciated."

"I assure you it is, Ubista, and I am convinced that if you are here, there is a good reason for it."

The small House Elf was the best hitman of the Kemenov clan, and his talents were not only known, but feared throughout Russia's clans.
Ubista, so close to the sound of the Russian word for 'assassin'...

"You are both right and wornd.
I am indeed on guard duty, but Knyaz Pokhastovine thinks unwelcome arrivals will happen tonight.
I have strict orders to permanently solve this problem ."

"And Sergei is usually right on security matters," Vladmir sighed.
"Am I an unwelcome arrival?"

"Using the Knyaz's strict words, you were not accounted for, therefor unwelcome.
However, I doubt the Matriarch and the Knyaz would appreciate to learn about your untimely end due to a literal application of my orders.
Why were you expelled, Highness?"

"I told you to stop with titles," the Kemenov heir sighed again.
"I am suspected to have assaulted students."

"Are they alive and in perfect physical integrity?" the House Elf asked, frowning.

"They are."

"Therefore, you are innoced.
If you were the culprit, they would be dead, or permanently disabled.
The Fedovir mercenary has a limp since your duel.
By the way, congratulations on your victory."

Vladmir was aused by Ubista's conclusion, and shrugged at the congratulations.
He had had time to grieve Natashka's death and, in some way, he nearly was grateful to Karzkern for casting the spell.
Seeing the girl again helped his grief.

"Unwelcome arrival, hey?" Vladmir suddenly said mockingly, as Apparition snaps rand out in the back alley.
"I'm gonna kill Sergei.
Immobilus, Stupefy."

He was efficient, and both unknowns were overpowerd before the House Elf needed to intervene.

"Why latin spell, your Highness?" Ubista wondered as, with a snap of his fingers, the two assailants were levitated.

"They are slavic.
Our magic has weird reactions to Latin magic if you are not used to it," Vlad answered.
"And stop with your 'Highneses'!"

"You are the Tsesarevitch!" the House Elf was offended.
"I only show you due respect!"

Vladmir grumbled, but did not answer more.
House Elves positively loved etiquette.
Ubista would not change is mind..."

He calmly followed the small being to the back entrance of the Palace and smiled when he smelled the sweet scents coming from the kitchen.

"Go see the cook, Highness, it is not warm here."

Vladmir nodded and let Ubista and his prisonners go, entering the warm and welcoming room that was part of the ground floor of the Kemenov Palace.
He observed the liveliness in the large room with a softened look.
Three women squeezed through the ranks of seven House Elves, ordering them around.
Four men, clan guards, were eating on one corner of the room, and there was laughter around.

Vlamdir finally relaxed.
He was home.

"Welcome Vladmir Vassilievitch!" one of the House Elves suddenly cried out, appearing in front of him.
"Please give me your belongings!"

Vlad smiled, and got his school robes off and took his suitcase out of his pocket, before getting pushed towards the guards table.

"Please sit down, Young Master!" the Elf ordered him, pushing the boy.
The four guards smiled and made a spot for the heir, who was given a cup of hot cocoa and a mountain of biscuits before he had time to protest.

"Vladmir Vassilievitch, how are you?" Friedrich asked, stealing a buscuit on the young boy's pile after checking the House Elves were not looking.

"I am fine, I have one additional week of holidays," said boy smile.

"Vladmir!"

A bear hug sweeped him off the ground, as a corpulent woman covered in flour picked up the boy and kissed him on both cheeks.

"Nouchka, let his Highness breathe," a low voice snarled, "and go back to your stoves."

The woman grouched but obeyed, hugging the young boy one more time.
The chief security vampire of the Kemenov palace smiled and leaned on the chimney.

"Sergei," Vlad greeted him, thanking him with his eyes.

"I did not count you in unwelcome arrivals, but Ubista just told me.
Although I would have known quickly."

The vampire looked at Nouchka, who had walked out, calling for the House Elves, yelling in the corridors that the young heir had arrived and that his appartments needed to be prepareed.

"Come, we..."

"No way the young master leaves without eating!" a young House Elf unexpectedly protested, towering below Sergei.

The vampire softly laughed, and sat down next to Vladmir.
He tended to forget the protecting tendencies of the Kemenov servants towards Vlad, and he did not want all of them against him...
A glass of blood was brought up to him, and a lively conversation started betwwen the six men.
Vlad explained to them why he was expelled, making all of the sigh in exasperation.

"On the other hand,", Vladmir concluded, finishing his cocoa, "it suits me well.
I have some things to do in the meantime."

"What kind of things?"

"Well, Professor Snape cannot leave Hogwarts without the Headmaster's permission.
The residency clause is quite specific for Professors.
He asked me to check his possessions with Gringott's as well as inquire why he never recieved any official document from them.
He dos not trust Dumbledore, and it seems Flitwick told him about my contacts with the Goblins.
I will go to the bank tomorrow."

"Anything else?"

"Yes, I need to be in Hogwarts tomorrow evening.
Levine, did you recieve the ingredients I ordered?"

"Indeed," one of the guards nodded, also the Kemenov Potions Master.
"I have the Ethiopian snake scales, and the Mermaid feathers.
Veritaserum?"

Vladmir nodded and stood up.

"Young Master, please don't plan anything on Wednesday," Friedriech declared after Nouchka whispered something in his ear.

"Why?"

"We are planning a banquet to celebrate your victory against Karzkern.
You avoided another clan warr.
It should have been done later, but you're here now."

Vladmir sighed, but he knew he could not avoid it, so he assured them he would assist, before he followed Sergei to his appartments, quickly checking up on the clan.
Nothing important happened since the previous time, and Vladmir was this happy when he got to bed that night.

<hr>

The next morning, he was well rested as he reached the monumental door of the Saint-Petersburg branch of Gringott's.
He walked to the available counterand politely greeted the goblin, noting the clerk's rank and name on the ornamentation of his vest.

"May your gold be prosperous, apprentice Karkor.
I wish to see Lord Gorkolk," he said.

The goblin's eyes widened when he heard Vladmir's perfect Gobbledegook, and noted his young age.

"Who asks for him, young wizard?"

"Vladmir Kemenov."

The young gobling simply nodded, and asked him to ait for a few moments to check if the director was available.
He came back a few minutes later, visible surprised, accompanied by Lord Gorkolk himself.
The branch's director only greeted important clients in person, and twelve-year-old Vladmir did not look this umportant.

"Vladmir Vassilievitch, it is a pleasure seeing you again," the goblin smiled, showing his fangs.

"Thank you Forge Master, may your gold be prosperous."

"May wealth come," the Goblin answered, as they bowed to each other.

Several Russian wizards observed the two of them, and Vlamdir eventually smiled as he saw the young Goblin's lost gaze.

"Keep your Life face, Apprentice Karkor," he softly said.

"The young Kemenov heir is Friend of the Goblin Nation," the Lord told his clerk.
"He knows our traditions.
Go back to work."

The young Goblin immediately stuttered excuses and walked away, as Vladmir looked at his friend and mentor with surprise.
He followed his to the offices.

"Friend of the Nation?"

"Since two months ago.
Lord Folblang and myself judged you worthy of this recognition.
You will officially be presented to the Goblin Nation in a ceremony this summer.
We were wating to see you in person to tell you."

"It is too grat of an honour."

"You deserve it."

Vladmir did not answer, still astonished.
The last human to be Friend of the Goblin Nation died two centures before.
With this recogntion, he had become an honorary member of the Goblin people, with unlimitted access to their realm, hidden deep inside the planet.
More importantly, he was an official ally of the Goblins.
Attacking Vladmir was the same as attacking a Goblin, and wizarding laws did not apply to him when on Goblin territory.
Not only did he gain recognition, he gained a partial immunity.
Vladmir would avoid magical laws as soon as he entered a magical bank.

"What brings you here, Vladmir Vassilievitch?" the Goblin eventually asked.

Vladmir looked at the Goblin for a few minutes.

"Vlad."

The Goblin's neutral mask softly cracked, and a strange smile appeared in his thin lips, as his entirely black eyes sparkled.
As with Russians, the use of names in Goblin conversation told one many things about the relationships between people.

"Lorcan."

Vladmir smiled himself, and nodded softly.
Never had a goblin allowed any one to call him by his first name, except his close friends and his family.
Vladmir had learned from the Goblin all the traditions of his people, he initiated him.
But their relationship had not yet changed from the teacher-student archetype.
Now, it had.

"Do you know the Prince line?" Vladmir asked, now informal following the use of their forst names.

"Yes. I also know whose line it is, and that's why we monitor them," Lorcan Gorkolk.
"Arthur's descendant has been discreet since his birth."

"No," Vladmir sighed.
"Severus Snape did not know his filiation."

The Goblin only frowned and raise a hand.

"Can I call the England Lord?
This case is primarily his."

Vladmir nodded and observed his mentor get a communication cristal out.
The conversation was brief, and a few minutes later, Klorgin Folblang, Hobgoblin and Lord of England, sliently entered the room, a voluminous book under his arm.
The young human loved the Goblins' transportation system.
They used some king of rune-based transfer gates.
They were not allowed to Apparate since the Great Goblin Wars, but they had found this way to travel.
Goblins thus avoided the wizards's surveillance, who closely noted each Floo movement.
They exchanged the usual greetings, then Folblang smiled at Vladmir.

"It has been a long time, young Kemenov.
The Forge Master said something about a problem with the last heir of the Princes?"

"Indeed.
Severus Snape would like to know the state of his finances and assets."

"Why did he not ask us himself?"

"He is closely monitored by Albus Dumbledore.
This man kept his ancestors hidden from him and he does not trust him any more."

"Understandable.
Albus Dumbledore lost the confidence of Gringott's the day we discovered his hiding of your parents' will."

"Erpick BlackClan told me that the only withdrawal at the death of the previous Prince patriarch was linked to an inheritance."

"Did he tell you exactly this?" the Hobgoblin was surprised.

"He did not, he simply supected an inheritance.
He did not have access to the account books and could not check."

"It was not an inheritance.
Severus Snape was still a minor.
During the two months preceding his majority, Albus Dumbledore, his magical guardian, withdrew from the Prince vaults the maximal amount for a legal representative twice.
Those amounts went to one of his accounts that is used exclusively for the Order of the Phoenix.

"You are saying that he pillaged the Prince vaults to finance the war against Voldemort," Vladmir summarised, his face now sombre.

"Indeed.
However, Lord Prince quickly became and adult, thus Albus Dumbledore had no access to the vaults."

"Very well, I will tell professor Snape tonight," Vladmir sighed.
"Could I have a document listing his assets?"

"It is no use, I would like to meet Lord Prince.
I know he cannot leave Hogwarts, but I gather that you are perfectly able to make me enter the school," the Hobgoblin smiled.

"You wish to meet him?" Vlad repeated.

"I do.
Because of their royal origins, the Prince vauts are personnally managed by the Lord of England.
I have been at this position for nearly two hundred years, and I am passably furious I never realized that Lord Prince had been despoiled."

Vlad held back a smile.
The Hobgoblin seemed expressionless, but he had gooten used to see the Goblins emotions through their faces.
From his tense posture, indee, the Lord of England was angry.

"Professor Snape was also wondering why he never received any transcript."

"We always sent them to his address, first at his Spinner's end residence, then at Hogwarts.
Some one thus intercepted them...
As it is relatively common that family vaults of old lines stay untouched for years to the benefit of a current account, it has not alerted us."

"I can bring you to Hogwarts without alerting the castle defences," Vlad eventually said, after a moment of silence.
"I have to cantact a friend first, however.
I would be honoured if you were to grace us with your presence at the Kemenov Palace around half past seven tonight."

The invitation, perfectly made, was obviously accepted.
The evening come, the Goblin Lord was in the state room of the Kemenov clan, waiting with curiosity they transportation method, while the young heir smiled mysteriously.
Fawkes then appeared in front of the Goblin Lord's astonished eyes, and Vlad laughed as he pet the phoenix.

"Hey, good biy, is Neville alrready in the HQ?
Good, can you tell him to write the address?
I have a last minute guest."

The phoenix cooed softly and disappeared again.
He nearly instantly reappeared, a small parchment around his leg.
Vladmir gave it to the Hobgoblin, who had an amused sneer when he understood why the note was needed.
On the parchment, in a fluid but still childish witing, an address was clearly visible.

"A Fidelius charm, extremenly ingenoious," the Goblin Lord admitted as he read the note written by the Secret Keeper.
As soon as he had finished, the parchment flamed up and Fawkes brought them with it.

They landed in the middle of the room, and Vladmir appeased his friend and Professor Snape with a hand gesture, as they all had their wands pointed on the Goblin.

"Please excuse me but..." Hermione said, looking at the thin and tall being who observed his surroundings.
"Who are you?"

"I am the Goblin Lord of England, Klorgin Folblang.
However, I think, miss, that your question was more along the lines of _what_ are you, was it not?
I am a Hobgoblin."

The Goblin Lord attentively looked at the young girl, and suddenly opened his eyes wide.
He quickly approached her, and brushed the child's hair, smelling her.

"To what do we owe your presence?" Severus frowned at the being's behaviour, while Hermioe, astonished, did not immediately react, speechless at the suprising act by the creature, before hurrying away.

Professor Snape was in front of a new door of the room, wand still in hand.
Vladmir supposed his new room was the Potions laboratory promised by Hogwarts.

"I am the Lord of England, and as such the manager of your family's vaults, Lord Prince," the Hobgoblin declared, his eyes not leaving Hermione, a wondering spark in his entirely black eyes.
"Numerous intrusions were noticed, and I wish to speak with you.
Vladmir Vassilievitch assured me that this place was perfectly safe, and far from the wandering ears of sope wizard I will not name."

Severus Snape loked at Vladmir warily, who simply smiled, immediately reassuring the man.
Both entered the Potions laboratory to speak privately, as Vlad was assaulted by Hermione.

"Blimey Vlad, it's too sad without you," the young girl sighed.
"And your friend is weird," the added after a few seconds.

"I know.
How is your sister?" Vladmir asked the Weasley twins.

"She feels guily, it's quite obvious.
She sobbed when Hermione spoke of your suspension in the common room.
You got expelled because of her, and I am sure she realises that she is responsible for the school's troubles."

"That's not surprising," Draco sighed.
"Possessed people are aware of what happens, but they feel like in a dream."

Vladmir sighed and looked at Luna, sitting in one of the armchairs in the room.
Her head was entirely inside André's hole, and they were in a deep telepathic conversation."

"Hey André, how is it going with Dumbledore?"

Luna partially put the Sorting Hat up, getting her face out of him to look at the Russian as a smile appeared in the venerable artefact.

"Albus is angry and panicked, as always!
He feels that everything is escaping his grasp.
I asked him why you were expelled, and he told me a wring answer."

"Wrong answer?"

"He called you a Dark Mage.
He nearly had a stroke when I told him that you were!
Sadly, he survived this encounter."

Vladmir wondered if he should smile at the idea of the Headmaster dead in his office, but he eventually grimaced.
Indeed, he was a mage, and used so-called Dark magic without a problem.
He was in the 'Dark Mage' category...
They talked for long minutes, before the laboratory's door opened to let the Goblin Lord out.

"Lord Prince wishes to talk to you, Mr. Kemenov."

Vladmir nodded and stood up, abandonning Neville and Draco to their chess game, Hermione and Kevin to complicated formulas, Luna and André in another conversation, and the Weasley twins to their ne prank.
Before he walked in, he saw the Goblin Lord looking at Hermione closely, leaning against a wall...

When he walkled into the small room, the Russian smiled.
I was austere and the light was scarce.
However, the Potions laboratory was usable and equipped with many cauldrons and fials.
It was a perfect place and he was sure that te Potions Master would quickly adapt to it.
Talking about him...
Severus Snape was leaning against a wall, paler than usual, and Vladmir smiled softly as he gor the pouch containg the last Potions ingredients out of his pocket.
He put them down on the central bench, clearly visible, and finally looked at Snape.

"When I asked you to get the goblins' opinion on my finances, I did not expect the Lord on England to come himself," the mand said with a toneless voice.

Vladmir looked at the wizard while casting privacy charms on the door.
He was probably at the end of his tether.
Too many revelations in the last few weeks.

"I am a Friend of the Goblin Nation.
It's only been a few weeks, but it justifies a preferential treatment.
Goblins know who you really are.
For them, Ancient magic is their usual magic.
You are its keeper."

"I... That's what the goblin told me.
He called me Majesty."

"You are."

"I do not want it."

"You are," Vladmir softly repeated.
"For them, you are the true leader of the wizards and witches.
As were your mother, your grandfather, and so on up to Arthur."

"He told me of the prophecy as well...
According to his people's shamans, it will happen soon."

"That's possible.
Prophecies are unclear, and you should not interpret them, however."

"You have quite the opposite stance to Dumbledore," the Potions Master joked.
"He is trying to get the one concerning you to happen at all cost."

"The one about me?" the Russian responded, frowing.

"You don't know?
Merlin... it's..."

"Professor?" Vladmir worried, seeing him grow paler, as if bad memories flooded Snape"s mind.

"It's my fault," the man whispered.
"It's my fault they are dead..."

"Who?"

Vladmir watched Severus Snape slump to the ground.
Too many questions raced in his mind.
What Prophecy was he talking about?
Who were dead?"

"Professor...
Professor Snape?
Severus?"

Vladmir kneeled next to the unreacting man, lost in his mind, and met his eyes.
He as immediately caught, traversing a huge castle to a dark room.
He then saw multiple scenes that made him sick.

An interview...
A partially heard prophecy...
Voldemort's red eyes when his Death Eater told him what he heard.
Severus Snape's pain when he realised who were the targets...
His tournaround...

"I am sorry..."

"It is not your fault," Vladmir slowly said, realizing what he had just seen, whi Severus Snape had admitted.
He did not feel any pain, just sadness and anger.
Dumbledore...
Dumbledore was responsible of the Potions Master's pain.
He pushed him into Voldemort's arms by hiding him the truth.

"My parents are dead, Professor, but you were not the one to raise his wand at them."

"I revealed the prophecy to him."

"And you inderectly were the cause of his downfall.
You are not reponsible..."

Vladmir did not know how to realt to all this sudden guilt, but help unexpectedly appeared.

"Leave it to me, Vlad!"

André perched on the Potions Professor's head, suddenly apprearing from nothing.

"Go, the Lord of England is wating for you to go back.
I'm going to help Sevrus.
It's too much for a single man."

"Take care of him André," Vlad whispered, "and keep me posted.
If need be, bring him to my home or Lucius Malfoy's."

"Don't worry boy, he's in good hands."

"You don't have hands."

"Buzz off insolent kid!" the Sorting Hat groaned before falling silent.

Vladmir left the room, and approached Folblang, who turne his head towards him.

"You know what she is," he whispered.

"I do, she does not. Not yet."

"She is sacred.
She must know."

"She will know it soon enough," Vlad whispered his heart aching, knowing what would soon happen to her friend, who as still so carefree, and now laughed with Kevin, eyes in their magical formulas.
