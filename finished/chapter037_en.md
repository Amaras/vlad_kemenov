# Chapter 37: Innocent

Draco, Kevin and Vlamdir had just finished their Runes lesson.
They found this subject fascinating, and they had acquired all the necessary basics.
Relentless work since the start of the year had given them the level of fourth years, to Professor's Babbling's great suprise and utmost pleasure.

Indeed, while the first two years of the Study of Ancient Runes class was normally only theoretical study, the amicable professor had caught them composing a simple but functional runes circle.
Which was not normally possible before the sixth year at Hogwarts.

This ancient form of magic, mainly used for defensive protections of buildingsn and the consolidation of spells for the long term, usually required a long study of runes and linking techiques before it could be used.
To discover that some new students were natually talented in this discipline enchanted her deeply.
Since then, Professor Babbling gave them the same homework as the others, but they would be marked on additional practical work, not the theoretical ones.

"Hi everyone!"

"Where is Hermione?" Draco asked, surprised to see Neville join them, alone."

"Here!
We have our group project now?"

Neville, who was about to answer, froze, before frowning as he saw her turn a corner, panting.

"How do you do that?" he asked.

"Do what?" she asked, reaching them.

"You were right behind me, and the next moment, you're turning the corner!"

"You're wrong," she said.
"I left you right after the DADA class to fetch my book."

Neville did not answer, looking suspiciously at the young girl.
She had never been a good liar...

"Let's go, we'll be late!"

And Hermione went to the classroom for their group work, avoiding her friend's interrogations.
Each research group had been given a space that they could use how they pleased.
They could event prepare Potions, as long as they warned their advisor!
With Professor Prince's help, they then put up specific protections.

The other members were already waiting for them, and they entered their own room, as was signaled by their names on a wooden pannel and the password asked by the doorknob.

"It's still as strange to me that we come here," Kevin sighed, throwing his bag on the table.

"What's so strange about it?" Hannah Abbot asked, putting her gear down more delicately.

"The other years, we mainly met each other at the library," Nevile answered, discreetly kicking his friend under the table for the slip.

Kevin help back a grimace, as Theo and Susan joined them with a flagrant lack of motivation.

It had been two weeks since they had started meeting for the group project...

Two weeks they were looking for a subject...

Two weeks that they argued, defending their proposals...

Two weeks that Theodore, Susan and Hannah felt excluded in the middle of the small group.

One had to be properly blind to miss the bond that the other five students shared, or at least simple minds, like some Slytherins Draco knew.
But it was not Theo's case, greatest observer in the school per Draco's words, not Susan's, who was used to seeing the truth under false prentences since childhood, nor even Hannah's whose shyness was balanced by a great analytical sense.

It was thus easy for them to understand that, if the small band seemed like mere friends at first glance, they were as close as a family in reality.

"You go to the Library since Professor McGonagall dissolved you club, right?" Theo asked, looking at Kevin get a pile of parchments out.

Curious, he took a paper and started at the incredibly regular calligraphied handwriting.

"Indeed," Draco nodded.
"How do you know?"

"You're speaking to The Slytherin Gossip," Theo simply said, still loooking at the Kevin's handwriting.

"That's pretty derogatory," Vlamdir intervened, entering the classwith Hermione
He immediately spotted that his favourite spot was free, and went to sit on the window sill.
Hermione, who wanted the same spot, slightly pused her legs to sit leaning on the window.

Susan and Theo looked at each other.
None of the Alliance members tried to show the restraint they had manifested until then.

"Are you alright Hannah?" Neville asked, letting his real personality show under the shy Gryffindor mask.
Indeed, as the two members of the Five Families had spotted, all the Alliance had decided to play pretend.
They would spend the whole year with them, way closer than any other student.
Their out-of-school activities were still secret, but not the signs of their close friendship.

The young blonde girl blushed at both Neville's question and his new calm and comforting aurat, but simply nodded.

"Not really," Theo said.
"She has gotten unpleasant remarks.
What's this quill?"

"A dip pen, the ancestor of Muggle ballpoint pen.
It has quite the advantage over quills, if you want my opinion!
No need to cut the tip, and the ink store is way better," Kevin answered, dipping his pen in the black ink.
"Professor Selwyn approved of it, mind you.
What do you mean by 'unpleasant remarks', Hannah?"

The sudden change of subject seemed to shock the thre Guests, as the Alliance core had gotten to nickname them.

"Did yo uget trouble?" Susan was surprised.
"Why didn't you tell me?"

"Some...
Some say you are together because you are Neville's friends.
And since Vladmir is here, they wanted to put the Five Families together...
Bones, Potter, and Nott.
Professor Prince is our advisor as well...
They say...
They say I'm here as...
As a stand-in," the young girl sniffled.

She tried hard to hold back tears, hardly taking these ugly remarks.

"Who?"

Hannah jumped when Hermione asked firmly.
They kind of voice oozing calm and comforting authority.
The young Muggle-Born had not stopped reading her book, like she was uninterested, but it was evident she was waiting for an answer.

"What?"

"Who told you that?" Hermione repeated, finally looking at Hannah.

Neither Susan, nor Hannah, nor even Theo could have imagined that her face could show that perfect of a coldness mask, worthy of any Pure-Blood.
Theo had a quick thought and did not miss the occasion to say it out loud.

"You know Professor Lupin thinks he knows your blood status?"

Theodore saw the brief spark of amusement in her eyes.
Hermione did not need to ask to know that the new Defence against Dark Arts professor thought she was a Pure-Blood.

"Same for Kevin."

Theo raised a surprised eyebrow and looked at the Ravenclaw, who gave him a deeply mocking smile.

"Seems like the star presenter of Slyther Radio doesn't know everything!"

Theo smiled back, appreciating this nickname way better than the 'Slytherin Gossip' one, before looking back at Hannah.

"So, who is it?"

"Weasley...
Justin as well...
And Parkinson..."

"Don't listen to them, they're all idiots," Hermione grumbled.
She had had quite the argument with Ronald Weasley on Divination the day after the start of the year, and she was still ruminating over the words he had told her.

"If you want my opinion, Hannah, I think jealously is really ugly," Vlad sniggered, making Hermione laugh out loud and Draco have an amused expression on his face.

"I'm doing to tell you the truth," the Russian continued more seriously.
"Yes, we are together because we are the first group of official friends across House borders that Hogwarts has known for the last two centuries.
Indeed, Susan and Theo are members of the Five Families, and it's likely that the Board of Governors wanted to mend the relationships that were thin for centuries.
But you are not a third wheel.
You are here because you are Susan's best friend.
As you might have noticed, we are all united, and while Theos knew us before, Susan would be alone without you."

"Friendship is sacred for wizards and witches," Kevin softly said, his head on his Potions homework.
"If you look closely, every member of the groups have at least a friend with them, at the very least an acquaintance.
They are not crazy enough to put us alone in the bear pit."

Once more, the Ravenclaw had the attention of the three Guests.

"I never realised that it was this much..." Susan whispere.
"Are you sure that...?"

Kevin raised his head and the look he gave them was deeply sarcastic.

"I am Muggle-Born indeed.
I also have the same knowledge of the magical world as any native, but Selwyn did not tell Lupin about Hermione and myself.
The bets are on about when he'll find out."

"Bets?"

"Come one Suze!
The Weasley brothers are real geniouses of organised crime," Theo said, rolling his eyes.
"All the Slytherins know that you need to ask them to have the bets and odds."

"I thought you needed to see Diggory?" Hannah whispered.

"Diggory is only their intermediaries in Hufflepuff, like they have a Slytherin and Ravenclaw in their sleeve.
I would event be they have a contact among staff."

Vlamdir, turned towards the window, smiled as he remembered the face Cedric Diggory, honorable Hufflepuff respected by his whole House, had made when he had discovered the Alliance's identity, and especially Professor Prince's presence among them.

One had to admit that he did not arrive on a good day...
Severus had left in a hurry from Salazar's Laboratories, only wearing darted trousers and an old shirt stained by manual labour, pestering against the presence of a sleeping Basilisk around his potion.
He had given Cedric a vague look, mumbled 'welcome to the Alliance', before grabbing Kevin and the twins.
The first seemed to be required to move Sasssly off, and the others to finish their Canary Cream potion.
Severus had had enough with the small peeps around the Weasley twins' cauldron.

To say that Cedric was shocked by the Professor's appearance, so far from the impressive dungeons bat and his infamous cape, as well as his attitude, was quite the understatement.

But once surprise wore off, Cedric was an excellent asset to the small group, the perfect intermediary for the twins.
Fred and George were still hesitating whether to introduce Lee Jordan, their best friend and accomplice from Gryffindor, worried about his reaction on secrets, as well as Marius Flint, Marcus's younger brother, who was their Slytherin accomplice.

"How about we go back to our project?" Draco asked, bringing everyone out of their thoughts.

"Good idea..." Kevin said, pulling a new parchment from the pile of books in front of him.
"Professor Prince told us we had until the end of the week to give him our subject.
Fortunately, we only have two choices left!"

"I like Hermione's idea," Hannah said in a quiet voice.
"I mean...
Since Kevin and her have the knowledge, it would be like we were all Pure-Bloods.
And according to Kevin, magical creatures are not in the syllabus of wizarding initiation this year."

"That's quite the heavy work," Draco said, reading the proposals again.

"Writing a book presenting the main sentient magical creatures interacting with wizards and witches", was Hermione's proposal.

"Report on the distinction between Dark Magic and Light Magic," was Theo's.

"The sencond one is pretty sensitive, even if Harry Potter the Boy-Who-Lived is the one presenting it.
Ouch!"

Kevin brushed the back of his head after Vladmir slapped it sneakily.
The topic of his status as a saviour was also sensitive?

"I like the second one better," the Russian declared.
"But the first one would also be very interesting.

"Eventually, they voted, and to their horror, Hermione, Susan, Neville, and Hannah chose the first one, while Theo, Vlamdir, Draco, and Kevin chose the second one.

"Come on," Kevin grumbled.
"Not again!"

Finally, Severus was the one to get them out of this conundrum when he went to see them.

"Why do you bother?
Professor Longbottom plans to renew those work groups every year.
Chose a subject and do the other one next year."

They finally agreed to present the subject on Dark magic this year, and started to gather the first ideas.

<hr>

"Finally, it's the weekend," Fred exclaimed, slumping on one the the HQ seats a few hours later.
All the members had received the meeting call thanks to Hermione's charmed Galleons.

"Just sleep..." a blond mass added, collapsing on the twins.

"Oi Luna, we're not..."

"... pillows!" George protested, shaking the young Ravenclaw.
However, nothing could wake up the already sound asleep girl.

"Blimey, does she always fall asleep that fast?" Cedric asked, sitting down on the couch.
The Hufflepuff had just discovered the truth, but he had already fit in perfectly.

"Always, especially when something bothers her," Hermione nodded.
"And always on someone."

Cedric looked as the young Gryffindor girl used a locomotion charm on Luna so that she slept more comfortably.
He then looked at Professor Prince, calmy marking papers on a desk in the Slytherin library.

To learn that, behind Fred and George, with whom he had worked for the last two years, there was a small organisation astounded him.
He had discovered that bets, contraband, but also the discreet but expanding business of paid homework were under the control of Vlamdir Kemenov, and not the twins.

Cedric, a fifth-year, was not the idiot.
Vladmir was the undisputed chief of this small group.
Under his innocent looks, he was a terrifying boy, and the worse part was that all the people around the room knew that...
Cedric rememberd the day after his introduction to the Alliance...
He had seen Kevin smile at a Slytherin student who had called him a Mudblood...
He still shivered at the coldness in his blue eyes, totally opposed to his smile.
The same student had an _accident_ the next week, sending him straight to the Hospital Wing.
And a rumour ran among the Pure-Bloods.
Constantin LLoyd had received a bunch of flowers.
It was composed of willow branches, symbol of grief, foxglove flowers, a lethal posion, and gladiolus, a sign a assured death, and the message could not be any clearer.
The sender was eveident for him...

In reality, Cedric was admirative of the organisation the teen group managed to start.
When most worried for Quidditch, the House Cup, or the classes, they had imposed a structure, whose revenues were impressive inside a school.
All had a role to play.

The Hufflepuff looked at the impressive tapestry representing the Alliance.
He had laughed when he had discovered that his totem animal was a dog, symbol of loyalty, while he wondered why some symbols seemed familiar.

He had also managed to associate each member to each animal on the tapestry, but he still hesitated between the crow, the snake and the salamander for Severus Prince, Kevin, and Vlamdir.
As for the sheep, he had no idea.
They had not introduced him to the last member, someone called André.

"Kevin, could you go see Ronald Weasley later?" the Russian asked as Severus settled down next to them on the sofa where Luna was, getting back Cedric's attention.

"To rearrange his face after insults to both Mione and Hannah?" Kevin asked with a sweet smile.

"No, no need for physical injuries," Vlamdir laughed in response.
"Just to tell him that Hannah has our support and that it would be best if he left her alone."

"Ronny is acting up again?" Fred signed.
"Come on, I might ask..."

"... if he really were our brother!"

"He's gonnay pay for it soon!
Our Canary Creams..."

"... are finally ready!"

"Thank Merlin," Severus added.

"Oi!
We haven't blown up the lab..."

"... this time!" George added.

"Admittedly, but your birds were starting to drive me mad."

"Madness can be sweet," Luna mumbled.

Under Cedric's astonished gaze, still not used to her shamelesness and Severus's strangely soft demeanor, Luna put her head on the shoulder of the dark Potions Professor, and got back to sleep, ignoring the unconvicing grumblings from the man.

"That deserves a picture, Sev'!"

"André, it's been a while!" Hermione exclaimed.

"Hi Andrade!"

"Kevin, what did I tell you?
André!" the Sorting Hat scolded him.
"Well, the young Diggory?
Is Hufflepuff still good for you?"

Cedric, gobsmacked, could do nothing but stare at the antique magical artefact calmly installed on the Potions Professor's head.
The sheep made sense now.
André was probably made of sheep leather...

"To what do we owe your presence?
Is the Headmistress's office too boring?"

"No!
Augusta redecorated!
It's much better, and Fawkes is still here!
I came here to see Vlad.
You have to meet with the Headmistress."

"Now?"

"When you've got time.
Augusta told me she knew you were a busy student."

Cedric wondered what the new Headmistress knew about te Alliance's activities, from the implication.

"By the way, Hermione, is the favour from the Ministry for your classes rumour true?" André asked while Fawkes appeared to move him to poor Cedric's head.
What was the famous pheonix doing there?
Wasn't it supposed to stay with his Master, Dumbledore?
Unless the former Headmaster never was his legitimate owner...

Hermione sighed when Vlad took the small chain on her neck that she had gotten out, and looked at it with a curiosity.

"Protection pendant?" Vladmir asked.
"I feel its magic."

Hermione had a sorry smile and nodded, putting the piece of jewellry back under her shirt.

"What do you call a protection pendant?" Kevin asked, frowning.

"Do you remember Hermione research for our alert Galleons?
We talked about locating charms for children."

Kevin nodded, wondering where the Russian was going with that.

"Well, those alert charms are generally found on protection pendants.
All Russian children get one, and I think it's the same in England.
Depending on the means and needs of the families, some other spells can be included.
Curse detection charms, long-range emergency Portkeys..."

Vladmir, to illustrate his words, took a thin band of leather from under his shirt.
A silver pendant stamped with the Kemenov coat-of-arms was dangling from it, as well as a second one with the Potter coat-of-arms.

"The Potter one was my early chidlhood one.
I keep it as a memory, but the one protecting it is this one."

Vlamdir pointed to the Kemenov coat-of-arms, including a black snake circling a silver knife.
He explained that silve was a magical catalyst, and that the stones that adorned the snake eyes were saphires, his birth stone.
He showed the back of his pendent.
Fine runes were etched, and he tapped his wand on them.

Several words appeared in the air.

> Name: Tsearevitch Vladmir Vassilievitch Kemenov, Prince Potter, Crown Prince of Kzerna.
>
> Blood type: AB-
>
> Medical history: Red Breath curse, Possession.

"The Kemenov pendant has detected sources of poison in a 1 metre radius since I got it.
And since the misfortune with Dumbledore, it also alerts me about thruth serums."

"Can Katya locate you?"

"No.
Because of our positions in..."
Vladmir fell silent, starting at Cedric, before shrugging.

"Because of our positions in the Mirage Court, it's too dangerous for anyone to know where I am, even my family."

Cedric nearly choked.
The Mirage Court?
The _Magical Mafia_?
By all the mages in the world, he did not expect to be working with one of the biggest criminal organisations in the world.
On the other hand, it explained the sudden development of the Weasley twins' trade since the Russian arrive.
If they were supplied by the Courts, the means were much higher.
He was going to ask about the implication of the Mirage Court in the Alliance, but he was overtaken.

"Do you have the same ones?" Hermione asked to anyone who would listen, curiosity clearly audible.

Draco and Neville took finely crafted pendants from under their shirts.
Silver with an emeral for Draco, gold and onyx for Neville.

> Name: Draco Lucius Malfoy, Heir Malfoy, Earl of Mondsery
>
> Blood type: O+
>
> Medical History: family history of Dragon pox

> Name: Neville Franck Longbottom, Heir Longbottom, Earl of Dollstohm
>
> Blood type: A-
>
> Medical History: arsenic poisoning, datura poisoning... Development of a total immunity to the following substances and their derivatives:

The list of poisons stretched over several line, which interested all, and scared Cedric.
Neville gave him a look before explaining.

"Master Line specialized in poisons," Neville argued with a contrite smile.
"I am immune to most poisons."

"Mom didn't want to give us protection pendants," Fred declared.

"Buy Dad considered it important, so..."

The twins took out bracelets stamped with the Weasley coat-of-arms.

"Strange coming from Molly.
I would have thought it would be the reverse.
She has more ambition than Arthur, and quite the overprotective mother," Severus said, leaning forward.

"I love Mom, but..."

"... she considers it outdated.
Dad was the one who taught us wizarding traditions.
He is pro-Muggle, but doesn't want to lose our wizarding identity..."

"Did you know that Charles was present at the Saturnalia ball this winter?"

"Yeah, he told everyone but Mom, Ron and Ginny.
Our younger siblings have taken too much from our mother."

"Well, I have a few things to say to Ron," Vladmir added.
"Kevin, could you take care of Parkinson and Finch-Fletchley?"

"No problem," Kevin calmly smiled, playing with his wand.
It was one of the things that Cedric had noticed.
None of them used the same wand in here as in class.
To avoid the Trace, they used a secondary weapon.

"Just a big scare?" the Muggle-Born asked.

"Yep.
With Dark Magic, if possible.
Slytherins already know who's behind Lloyd's accident, so they'll think twice about hurting Hannah.
Mione, you should come with him to see Finch-Fletchley."

"I won't intervene for Parkinson.
No use hightening tensions with Slytherins for her, but I'll be delighted to do that for Justin," Hermione nodded.

"Draco, stay neutral in that.
You are still the Prince of Slytherins, and this position is still useful to us.
Cedric, could you show that Hannah and Susan are under your protection?"

"It has already been the case since I was Susan's witness at your official presentation.
Not enough, it seems.
I'll see them later tonight," the Hufflepuff declared.

"Let's start with Ron?" Neville asked.

"I'm coming with you," Draco declared with an impatient smile.

"Ooh, a Slytherin in the Gryffindor room?" Fred was extatic.

"Can I come?" Cedric asked.
"I've always wanted to see the other common rooms."

"Well, I count on your to give me memories," Severus declared, having followed that intently.
"If there is the slightest problem give me a sign, especially with Minerva.
She can be bitter when someone hurts her students."

He softly shook Luna, who fluttered her eyes about, before smiling dreamily.

"For the lil' wolf?" she asked.

"Indeed, Wolfbane Potion," Severus said, standing up to go the Salazar Slytherin's laboratories.

Augusta knew those new labs, and Hogwarts had kindly created a door between the office and the Chamber of Secrets when he asked.

"By the way, Miss Granger," the Potions Master said before leaving the library.
"The idea of paid homework is excellent, especially with the price you and Mr. Entwhistle ask.
But be careful: while you perfectly imiteted Miss Edgecombe's handwriting, I recognised your style in the homework.
I have to admit that you have a gift for magic-less contraband, Miss Granger.
You should practice on something else, like art pieces.
It's a market that is not developed enough for the demand from the Courts."

On those words, Severus went back to his research, leaving Hermione lost in thought before the whole Alliance went to Gryffindor tower.

After Neville gave the password to a Fat Lady who sang atrociously abdly, the Alliance entered the common room in good humour.
The lively conversations of the twenty or so students there died down while students from other Houses entered the room, until they stopped completely when Draco passed the portrait, talking with Hermione.

"Really, Hippogriff?
Were you inspired by the first lesson of Care of Magical Creatures?
I heard that Goyle was injured by this beast!
His father filed a complaint to the Board of Governors."

The Slytherin's haughty voice rang out in the suddenly quiet room, and he stared in disgust at the colours in the room.
Behind him, Credric seemed to like the room, looking over the walls and portraits.

"Oi Mione!
What is this damn snake doing here?" Ronald Weasley spat out, walking with Dean and Seamus.
"Vlad, I know you like him, but he's not welcome here!"

"Well, Ronny dear, apparently you gossip about one of your classmates?" Fred declared with a false joy, taking him by the shoulders, as did George.

They also prevented him to approach the young Malfoy, who only responded to Ron with an expressionless look.

"You know we like Vlad and his friends!
Try not to make any unpleasant comment about them, especially in front of us, Ronny dear!"

The Gryffindors slowly gathered behind the redheads, looking warily at the students from the other Houses.

"We're not here to bother you," kevin declared.
"We'd just appreciate if Rone and his friends stopped denigrating Hanah Abbot.
She's really down because of what you're telling about her."

"I do not repeat more than what the rumours say."

"And who's propagating those rumours?" Vlad asked.
"I thought you were smarter, Ron.
You're the best strategist in our year, you should know what impact this kind of gossip has."

"I don't know who started those stories," Ron said after a few seconds of silence.
"I am sorry she feels so bad.
I think apologies are required?" he added.

"Oh!
You have developped a good head on your shoulders now?"
George said mockingly, ruffling his brother's hair.

"I understood the lessons last time," Ron moaned in response.
"I don't want to be your prank victim for a whole month again.
But I'm still opposed to a Slytherin's presence here!"

"Sorry Weasley, I wanted to see your common room.
How can you live with some many garish colours?
It's giving me a nasty headache!"

He immediately incurred the wrath of the twenty Gryffindors present, and made an amused pout in response.
It was so easy to mock them!

"Dray..." Hermione sighed.

The young blonde fell silent, pinching his lips, but gave the Gryffindors a mocking look.

"Well, I can understand why Malfoy, Loony, and..."

"How did you call her?" Kevin suddenly growled, even before noting the painful look in his friend's eyes.

"What?"

"How did you call Luna?" the Ravenclaw repeated, wlaking towards Dean.

"It's the name everyone calls her!" the Gryffindor tried to argue.

Kevin brutally caught Dean's robes and got closer to him.

"Call her that one more time," he whispered, "and you'll dicover that I am not as kind as I might be."

"You bas..."

Dean took his wand out, but Kevin took him by the wrist and painfully twisted it, before taking his wand, as Dean moaned in pain.

"Luna is a very good friend, and she is Ron's sister's best friend," Kevin harshly said.
"As for everyone, she has feelings.
You think that gossiping and giving degrading nicknames doesn't hurt the targetted people?
Hannah nearly sobbed because she felt inferior to us because of your stories.
Luna shakes every time she hears that nickname!
That's the Gryffindor courage?
How brave you must be to gossip like that!"

"Mister Entwhistle!
What are you doing?"

"He attacked be, Professor!" Dean groaned, getting a contemptuous look from Professor McGonagall.

"I expect more strength and honesty from my students, M. Thomas.
I have been here since your comrades from other Houses arrived here, and i knwo you tried to hex him.
You have thus lost five points for this, and another five for the lack of respect for your schoolmate.

"As for you five...
I am not surprised by the presence of Mr. Entwhistle and Kemenov, as they have come numerous times.
However, Mr. Diggory, and especially Mr. Malfoy, I did not expect you to come here.
Are you looking to spy on the Quidditch strategies of my team to win the cup?" she joked.

Some discreet laughs rose up in the room as the Gryffindors went back to what they were doing before, appeased by the presence of their Head of House.

"I was curious to discover the Gryffindor common room," Cedric admitted.
"I was talking with Fred and Geored when they discovered that some students had a tendency to discredit a young Hufflepuff girl.
I thus followed them."

"And Hannah is part of my reasearch group," Draco said, slightly haughty.
"Even if she is a Hufflepuff, she deserves better."

"So you have come to settle some scores...
Why haven't you come to see me?"

"With all due respect, Professor, I do not trust you."

Minerva McGonagall shivered at the cold tone from the young Kemenov, but could only nod at the painful truth.
His wariness was perfectly understandable, and apparently shared by his aunt, who still had not deigned to respond to her letter, after two whole months...

"And above all, despite his deplorable character, I like Ronald."

The young redhead made a sound between protest and satisfaction, the insult being compensated by the compliment.

"Well, Ronny, Vlad likes your strategy..."

"...talents, it seems!
Try not..."

"... to make an enemy out of him..."

"... by talking faster than your thoughts."

The evening ended quickly in good humour, except for a handful of people.
The first one was Pansy.

As the meal ended and the Slytherins went back to their common room, Pansy Parkinso was attacked with her two Housemates and bodyguards.
She did not have time to react to the three red rays flying towards them, Stupefying them efficiently.

For several long minutes, nothing moved around her, but slowly, the shadows began to move.
The three Slytherins felt panic rise, as a slight gust rose in the darkness, slowly turning around them like a predator.
The unknown person did not show themselves, and suddenly, Pansy felt her heart skip a beat.
She would have screamed if she could as a soft hand pushed away a strand of hair, and someone talked into her ear.

"So, Pansy, looks like you're the one who started the harassement of Hannah Abbot," a cold voice whispered.

Pansy held back a shiver of fear.
She was at the mercy of someone, probably a student...
But who?

Kevin, in his victims' backs, looked at the sweat drop along Pansy Parkinson's neck, and softly followed the trace of the drop with his finger.

"Are you afraid, Pansy?" he asked softly.
"Neither Vincent not Gregory can help you.
You are at my mercy..."

Kevin observed with a smile the new shiver running in the young Slytherin's body, as he let his hand run down her back onto her lower back.
Some things were so evident in the Pure-Blood world...

"I could do so many things to you for having dared to hurt Hannah, you're not so ugly, Pansy...
Or maybe I could call a friend with much more radical methods...
You Housemast Lloyd knows him.
But I am much worse..."

The young Parkinson shivered again as a tear ran down her cheek.
She had never been the victim, always the executioner...
And what her aggressor implied...
His hand on her lower back, caressing her hips...
She would rather face Entwhistle.
At least she would suffer, but her honour would not.

"Remember this, Pansy," her aggressor continued with a smile she could not see.
"Hannah and Susan are under protection.
Don't try anything against them, you'd regret it."

And suddenly, no one was in the corridor.

When the three students got to the Slytherin common room, Drago, talking with Theo and Blaise, saw Pansy distraught and her two bodyguard terrified.
Kevin had done perfectly well.

"What is making you smile?" Theo asked.

"Nothing.
Just good news..."

The second person who did not like his evening was Vladmir.
Everything was good until he entered the Headmistress's office.
Katya, Lucius and Augusta were there, sitting in the small relaxation space created by the new Hedmistress.

"Vlamdir, please come sit down," Augusta sighed.

"Should I call you Headmistress or Mrs. Longbottom?" Vlamdir asked, stiff.

"Augusta, Vladmir."

"Black?" 

"Yes," Katya sighed.

Vladmir looked at his aunt warily, worried.
The Kemenov matriarch sighed again and stood up to hug him.

**"I am not angry at you, Kitten.
I was worried for you, and you were furious for this."**

**"I am sorry aunty.
I... I told you horrible things..."**

**"Things you did not think, I know,**" Katya whispered.
**"You told be in your letter.
And you'll be angry again..."**

**"Black..."**

**"Yes.**
Sit down."

"What is going on ?" Vladmir asked, sitting down.

"I eventually found the case against Sirius Black," Lucius declared.
"It had been sealed by Dumbledore, and it took a month until I found it.
There was no trial, but we're now certain of it."

"No trial?" Vladmir whispered angrily.
"Not a disaster."

"Vlamdir," Katya sighed.
"Goblins have traces of all Fidelius Charms placed on a home beloning to an estate they manage.
It is a secret only known by Triads, to find deserters they look for."

Vladmir knew this quid pro quo between the Goblins and the Mirage Court, stemmed from centuries of alliances between them.

"So?" the Russian mumbled.

"So the Potter estate has been managed by Goblins for centuries, and the Godric's Hollow house was part of it.
They thus know the Secrets Keeper, as well as the caster.
Albus Dumbledore placed a Fidelius Charm on your parents' house, and Peter Pettigrow was the Secrest Keeper."

Vlamdir froze.
He breifly noted that Dumbledore had always known the truth, but it was not what kept his attention.
The memory of his meeting with Black turned before his eyes.
He had seen him nearly every night in his dreams, but also during the day thanks to Occlumency.
And Vlad rememberd the brief moment when he had met the dog's gaze.
The pain he had seen...

"He's not..."

"He is innocent," Lucius declared softly.

"I..." Vlamdir swallowed hard, increasingly restless.
The three Triads looked at him slowly growing paler and paler.

"I met Black..." the Ravenclaw eventually admitted.

"When?"

"During the holidays.
Just before the trial...
And..."

Katya did not try to press him.
She knew her nephew, and he was clearly upset by this meeting.

"And I wonded him," Vladmir whispered, mortified.
"I injured an innocent..."
