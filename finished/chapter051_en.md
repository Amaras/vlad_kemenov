# Chapter 51: Revelations and Presentations

The Sunday morning, the day after the champions were chosen, were hard for every one.
Even the Slytherins had partied to celebrate the presence of not one, but two Dark wizards in the Tournament.
There were actually three, but they would only learn about it during the first task…

In the Slytherin fourth-year dormitory, Blaise groaned when sitting up, mumbling about the FireWhiskey Flint had gotten.
He thought ‑ but not too loudly, his headache was bad enough ‑ that he would need to extort the way he managed to smuggle alcohol in the school out of the Quidditch captain.
As Blaise was still grumbling about doctored alcohol, Theo got out of the bathroom, perfectly awake and already dressed.

"Hello, Sleeping Beauty!"

Blaised turned his head towards his alram clock and wrinkled his nose in a habit he got from his mother.
Theo did not know if it was because of the time or his reference to the Muggle fairy tale, as Mary-Ann had graciously nicknamed Draco that way.

"Theo, it's only 7…
Merlin, it's Sunday!
Even Mary-Ann and Daphne don't barge in the dormitory until 10!"

Theo shivered despite himself at the memory of the last time the girls woke them up.
While Mary-Ann was only bothering Draco for now, she had found a dangerous accomplice in Daphne Greengrass, who tool pleasure in waking *them* up, arguing that there was no reason that only Draco had this favour.

The noise of wrinkled fabric could be heard, and Draco squeezed his head through the curtains, still sleeping, asking what was happening for them to make so much noise this early.

"Draco… your eye is red and split, is that normal?" Blaise slowly asked, now perfectly awake.
The Slytherin, who had just gotten up with the trace of his pillow incrusted in his cheek, froze.
He distractedly brushed the mark and gave his friend an undeniably reptilian eye.

"I beg your pardon?" he mumbled.

Theo, who had sat down on his bed, threw a small mirror he had just transfigured and Draco looked at his reflection's gaze.
While his right eye was still the distinctively Black stormy grey, his left eye had changed.
The iris was now a too familiar bloody red, and the pupil was abnormally split.

Swearing, he jumped out of bed and asked for the time.
He had to talk to Vladmir!
He had already told him about the fact that Hogwarts had talked to him… and this new eye looked too much like the dragon's for it to be a mere coincidence.

"Seven," Theor answered slowly.
"Draco, I know you have your secrets, but has this sudden… change got something to do your mysterious escapade a few nights before?"

Draco did not answer, simply staring at him.
The heterocromia was really unsettling, and despite all his will, Theo looked away.

"I promise I will tell you," Draco eventually whispered after he made sure Crabe and Goyle were still snoring in their beds.
"But there will be a condition…"

"A vow?" Blaise guessed.

Draco nodded.

"Pomfrey?"

"No," Draco whispered, hurrying to get dressed.
"Professor Prince…"

<hr>

Meanwhile, as Draco was hurrying in the dungeons' corridors, Vladmir and Kevin were climbing down the stairs for get brekfast in the Great Hall.
It was a well known fact that the Ravenclaws were the earliest risers out of all the Hogwarts students and even on Sundays, it was not rare to find one of them early in the morning working or reading in hte Great Hall.

Thus, the huge room was nearly empty, apart from a few Ravenclaws, but the Gemini were surprised to see a few adults sitting down at the Ravenclaw table.
Very familiar adults, but rarely ever in the school.

Katya, her short hair disheveled and her eyes with dark circles because of a sleepless night, had a threatening face.
She was crushin a poor potato in her plate, mumbling curses while, next to her, Sergei was looking at the ceiling with muredrous eyes.
The most surprising was the presence of Sirius, ruminating dark thought, inelegantly slumped over the table.
They all gave off an aura so harsh they the present students had left quite a few places on each side.

**"What are you doing here?"** Vladmir asked, sitting down opposite Sirius, while Kevin, after quickly greeting them, turned to go sit with Theo and Blaise at the Slytherin table, there despite the early hour.
His instincts told him to avoid the adults for now, and judging from the face Draco's friends pulled, something was wrong within the snakes' House.

Katya, to her nephew's question, gave him a quite bitter look and stabbed her fork in the mash.
Under the magical spark, the piece of silverware went through the mash, the plate, and got deep into the table.

**"Augusta told me about your… forced participation,"** the Russian witch grumbled, while lightning lit up the room.

**"Katya… it's getting cloudy,"** Sergei said, still staring at the magical ceiling.
He was not wrong.
Above the Ravenclaw table, thick black clouds were gathering.

**"Dear cousin, you are scaring half the students,"** Sirius completed with a smile.

**"Katya!
I did not allow you to stay in the Great Hall to scare off my students,"** Augusta sighed, approaching them.
"In my office after breakfast, Mister Kemenov," she added in English.

"Yes, Headmistress," Vlad sighed, his look questionning her.

But the Longbottom matriarch did not add anything and she got back to the Professors' table and he guests.
The Russian wizards and witch and Sirius started to talk in a low voice about their latest adventures.
Vladmir was talking about the vow of vengence when the Durmstrang students entered.

The vision of the vampire and the Russian witch sitting down next to Vladmir made them pause, before they started walking to the Slytherin table again.
While many deferently greeted the Kemenov matriarch and Sergei while walking next to them, some were more afraid.

Karkaroff's reaction was the most memorable.
He even detoured to avoid meeting them.
The Durmstrang Headmaster perfectly remembered what had happened to Felix Darerine and Ilyna Dolohov, both former Death Eaters like himself.
He knew perfectly well who assassinated them, and he was trying to avoid the Kemenovs as much as possible.
He was not certain that snitching on his former allies had made clan Kemenov more sympathetic to him.

When the three adults and Vladmir gave the Durmstrang Headmaster a threatening look, all the people in the Great Hall could see him shake, and turn on his heels to flee the Great Hall.

**"If it's him…"** Sergei started calmly, putting his elbow on the table with a predatory smile, **"I will make it a pleasure to throw him into the prey pit."**

Some Durmstrang students, who were listening out of curiosity, turned a sickly green, which made Sergei chuckle.
The prey pits of the vampiric clans were synonymous with a slow and painful agony.
The pits were veritable hiding pens where the humans or magical creatures were released in a determined place, and the vampires took their time to play with their preys and slowly bleeding them out.

**"No, he's mine,"** Vladmir groaned, quickly helping himself to three toasts.
**"Whoever it is, they are my prey, Sergei."**

**"Yes Kitten,"** the Vampire sighed, noticing from the corner of his eye that Professor Prince was quickly talking to the Headmistress and went back out with her as quickly.

**"You think the bearded old man and his lover are behind it?"** Sirius asked with an atrocious English accent that hurt the ears of the three Russians.

**"Either them, or the ectoplasm,"** Vlad grumbled while standing up, finishing his gulp of tea.
**"I don't know which one I prefer to face on this.**
We have an appointment."

Accompanied with his family, he went to Augusta's office, to find not only her, but also Draco and Severus.
The young Malfoy was slowly petting Fawkes while the bird was signing a comforting melody.

"Vlad…
I have a problem," Draco mumbled, turning to his friends.

"I think 'problem' is an understatement," Severus whispered as the Russians discovered his new pupil.

"Sit down," Augusta sighed, making enough seats for all of them with a flick of her wand.

Vladmit sat down next to Draco and gave his an questionning look, while Sirius, who had grown to like his first cousin once removed despite his unceasing arguments with Lucius, sat down on the other side to support him.

"Draco came this morning with Severus to signal a partial transformation," the Hogwarts Headmistress sighed.
"Taking into account your trip a few nights back, I think it has to do with Hogwarts.
While you are here for Vladmir and the Tri-Wizard Tournament, it will have to wait, Katya."

"I understand Augusta.
Vladmir is not in immediate danger, but it's uncertain for Draco.
Does your father know?" Katya asked Draco softly, looking at him.

"Not yet," he sighed.
"I don't want him to worry for nothing."

"He will be worried in any case, little Dragon," the Russian witch sighed.
"And he might be angry he did was not informed immediately."

"I think you'll be able to calm him down," Draco sniggered despite himself.

Katya gave him a playful look.

"Well, my dear son-in-law, I don't doubt it for a moment, but I doubt you want to know the details."

Draco turned slightly green in response, a mental image burned into his mind, while Vladmir was mumbling something about drown ups and Severus, Sirius and Sergei giggled.

"Draco, do you think what is happening to you is linked to the fact that Hogwarts named your Protector?" Augusta intervened, crossing her hand in front of her face, giving the teenager a serious look.
Around them, Vladmir could see the portraits of the former Headmasters leaning in their paintings, curious and serious.
Strangely, he did not remember seeing them so… alive in Dumbeldore's time…
Maybe he had made them sleep to prevent them from questionning his very dubious management of the school…"

"I do not know," the Slytherin sighed.
"Maybe André might know more."

"If I may, dear," one of the Headmaster intervened, smiling at the small group in the office.

"Please, dear Phineas."

"If this child has met the castle's dragon, he should immediately go see the Founders."

"From what I have understood, Mister Malfoy here and his friends have discovered their tapestry.
Hadmaster Black is right.
It is simply to go to them," a witch with a friend smile added, the faded colours revealing how ancient her term was.

"You are right…
I think it is time I visit my illustrious predecessors," Augusta declared, "and since Andrade cannot be found, I do not see any other solution."

Indeed, the Headmistress's first idea would be to ask for the Sorting Hat's opinion, as the young Slytherin had proposed.
As brother to the Founder and member of the staff since the creation of the school, he could have an idea on Draco's new transformation.
However, the magical entity had disappeared, and Fawkes had refused to find him.

<hr>

"Back already?" Gryffindor, in his tapestry, was surprised when he saw the small delegation come back.
"And new heads…
How did you go through the protections?"

"I am Augusta Longbottom, Hogwarts Headmistress," the old woman replied calmly.
"Mister Kemenov here told me about your fortuitous meeting the night before during their little escapade.

"You status as Headmistress indeed allow you to pass through the protections.
But I doubt the Selkies would let a vampire through willingly," Slytherin declared, looking warily at Sergei."

"Come on Salazar, that hurt," the vampire ironically responded.

"Sergei?"

This time, the voice was Hufflepuff's.
Even though the portraits on the tapestry could not cry, the shaking in her voice was obvious.
Immediately, Rowena embraced her friend's shoulders to comfort her and looked daggers at Sergei.

"Hello Helga," the Russian vampire whispered, paler than he should be, even as a vampire.

"Rurikid," Gryffidor spat out.
"What are you doing here?"

Katya and Vladmir jumped at the name, one that came from the oldest dynasties of Tsars of all russia, as the vampired sighed at the three muderous looks from three of the Founders.

"It is Pokhastovine now, and has been for nearly a millenia," Sergei declared softly.

Immediately, the Founders froze and the hatred in the eyes of Slytherin and Gryffindor lessened, although it was still there.

"You were transformed by Dimitri Pokhastovine?" Ravenclaw asked slowly.

"I never wanted it."

"No one would ever want to be associated with this madman, even less so to be created by him," Gryffindor mumbled.

The Founders knew this ancient vampired, a crazy one.
Next to him, Dracula's stories were stories for children, pleasant ones.
The rivers of blood and screams that were caused by Dimitri Pokhastovine were responsible for part of Sergei's bloody reputation.
Being his creator could only make the current Knyaz Pokhastovine a killer without qualms.

"I killed him when I was old enough to free myself from him," Sergei said slowly.
"But I had already been transformed for two centuries."

"Stay after they are gone, Rurikid.
We need to talk."

Sergei nodded and gave Katya and Vladmir a reassuring gaze, silently promissing them to explain the situation afterwards.

"Why are you here?" Hufflepuff eventually asked, slightly sniffing and discreetly looking at the vampire.

"For Draco Malfoy," Augusta declared, putting her hands on the shoulders of the young Slytherin.

"Oh, Merlin!" Ravenclaw yelled, putting her hans to her mouth.
"A Protector!"

"I do not remember when the last one appeared, " Gryffindor mumbled.
"You should ask Andrade."

"We can't find him."

"What day is it?" Ravenclaw asked.

"The first of November."

"This month marks the death of our sister Melisanth," Slytherin said.
"He always spend some time on her grace."

"Her… grave?"

"Croftburg's Cemetary.
Do not tell me they dared to built atop the cemetary?" Hufflepuff was horrified.

"Cortfburg is not called Hogsmeade," Sergei informed them."

"Hogsmeade?" Gryffindor chuckled.
"That is just horrible."

"Hogwarts' mead hall become Hogsmeade when you contract the words," Sergei sighed.
"Brittish wizards are definitely not brilliant in our day."

"Oi!" Draco took offence.

"He is right, Draco, it's it just the truth.
Only very few wizards and witches dare to look at the truth and not rest on the laurels of last centuries…
And I'm still nice."

"Father will be happy to hear your opinion," the Slytherin sniffed.

"He knows is already," Katya smiled softly.
"Before we got together, I'll remind you that our conversations were professional.
What is happening to him?"

The Founders looked at each other and turned their attention to the undeniably aristocratic young man who that was standing in front of them his different coloured eyes staring at them in worry.

"Hogwarts, our Dragon Protector, has chosen a champion.
I think it is to protect the young…"

"They know about Hermione's nature," Draco reasured Ravenclaws when he noticed her hesitation.
She sighed in relief.

"The ancient races of Dragons protected the Licorines with their lives.
You have probably hear Muggle stories about dragons guarding princesses?
The myth of Saing George of Lydda?"

"The Muggle saint who killed a dragon?"

"Indeed.
The king's daughter, the one it followed recently after its defeat to George, was a Licorine.
They are treasure to their eyes.
Quasi-divine beings.
As Hogwarts is magically bound to the castle, he delegated his Protector status to this young man, and he gave him part of his powers."

"Powers?" Draco nearly choked in horror.

"I do not know which ones," Gryffindor apologized.
"You will need to research Icelandic purple dragons yourself…"

For a while, the wizards, witches and Founders talked, including about a duplication of the tapestry so that one was installed in the Headmistress's office.
Then they left Sergei to face his old life.

<hr>

A new week passed.
A week during which the delegations miwed with the Hogwarts students for their lectures.
The news of the moment passed and the school routine restarted, between homework, lectures, and the Alliance evenings.
Draco had managed to cast a powerful camouflaging spell in his eyes.
After he had talked with the Founders, now in the Headmistress's office, his father and Augusta, they had thought that revealing his Protector status was not a good idea.

On the staurday morning, while Draco and Hermione were researching Icelandic purple dragons, a bad surprised arrived, in the shape of a stranger.

**"Aleksei Lyvonovitch Vasefine?"**

The Russian, who was helping Vladmir's friend in his research, calmly sitting down in the Great Hall, looked up from his book and became slightly pale.
The newcommer, accompanied by Karkaroff and Minerva McGonagall, was tall, had sharp features.
He breathed authority and wealth, but on his leather vest lined with fur, a shield was visible, a shield that meant trouble.

Vladmir arrived this instant in the Great Hall, along with kevin and Neville, all three carrying books on dragons.
Immediately, he noticed the blond man standing in front of his childhood friend and frowned.

"Stay back and don't intervene," he wispered to his friends, putting his pile away on one of the benches at Ravenclaw's table.

**"I am, what can I do for you?"** Aleksei asked in a confident voice, despite his paleness.

**"I come in the name of Ratslav Dlavonine."**

**"I you hope that I influence my father's decision to ensure he accepts your conditions, I am sorry to disappoint."**

**"You should try, your sisters…"**

The man fell silent when Aleksei's wand appeared at his nose, while a long knife was pointed at his back at the veiled threat.
Professor McGonagall sobbed in surprised but did not try to intervene, while several students around them yelled as they understood what was happening.

**"Clan Vasefine is under the protection of clan Kemenov,"** Vladmir declared, appearing between Aleksei and the newcommer, knife still in hand.

**"The Krum family also supports the Vasefines,"** a hoarse voice delcared.

Viktor had just appeared behind Aleksei, amrs crossed and an annoyed look on his face.
But his eyes were hard and unambiguous, as was the threat in his words.
Slavic families had less impact than clans had, but they still were dangerous and influent.

**"Clan Kemenov has made themselves clear that hurting my family would be dangerous,"** Aleksei declared coldly, comforted by the presence of his allies.
**"If you want to trigger a clan war, please continue like this."**

**"You…"**

A thin hand caught the man's wrist before he had time to physically assault the Vasefine heir.
The attack had been totally deliberate.
By hiting Aleksei, the point was to offend the Vasefine family and push them to act recklessly.
The insult being public, Aleksei's father would not have any other choice than responding by a duel.

**"You?"** Katya asked affably, a glacial smile on her face while mentally sighing.
She had come with Sergei to see her favourite nephew and help him navigate the future tasks, but also announce a few bad news…
She had arrived just in time…

**"Ma… Matriarch Kemenov?"**

"Augusta… I am sorry," Katya declared softly.
"Clan Dlavonince has just kidnapped the two youngest daughters of the Vasefine patriarch.
It is a declaration of war."

The Hogwarts Headmistress opened her mouth, but she had no time to talk.
In one quick movement, Katya slit the Dlavonine emissary's throat, spraying blood on the Deputy Headmistress and the Durmstrang Headmaster.

**"Aleksei Lyvonevitch Vsefine, go back to Russia.
Have women and children go to Pokhastovine Palace, they will be safe there.
Have your family ready.
Tonight, blood will flow."**

Katya, without sparing a look for the hundreds of now hysterical studets, took the corpse and threw a small object to Vladmir.

**"See you at home, Vlad."**

And she disappeared after having triggered the first act of a clan war.

<hr>

Barely a dat later, in a small Russian town, the air was full of blood and soot, as a teenager contemplated a vast but now silent domain.
Around him, silouhettes were rising up, going for body to body, healing the wounded.
A few whispers and lights moved over the snow, but now was time for mourning.

Vladmir closed his eyes, weary, wanting to erase the memories for the night.
His clothes stank of blood, he still had bits of flesh in his hair, and above all, he still remembered the imploring clear eyes of Dlavonine's wife.

**"Are you alright, Kitten?"** Katya asked softly, sitting down next to him.
A rhetorical question he still chose to answer.

**"No,"** he whispered.

It was the first time he had been an aggressor in a clan war.
On the three he remembered, the Kemenovs had been the targets of the previous two…
There was a huge difference between defending yourself and your loved ones, and attacking with the intention to kill as many men as possible.

His only comfort, if you could call it that, that that the Kemenovs never killed the children although the rist of revenge was higher.
However, all people over 15 in clan Dlavonine were killed, apart from a few Russians who made a blood oath never to harm clan Kemenov or its allies.

Katya sighed and hugged him.
Vladmir closed his eyes and let go, tears rolling down his cheks.
Twenty seven people were killed by his clan and its allies, two thirds of a famous clan.
Clan Kemenov also suffered casualties.
Seven guards and one of his cousins.
He knew them all.
He remembered laughing wiht some, crossing paths with others in the Kemenov palace corridors…
His only satisfaction was knowing that Aleksei and his two sisters were alive.

**"Vlad…"**

He raised his head to look at his best friend.
He gave him a slight smile, noticing that Aleksei was as pasty as he was, and visibly wounded.
Behind him, his father, an arm completely bandaged, stayed immobile, face turned towards the Dlavonine palace on fire.
The town of Kuskovo, a few kilometres away, had not yet realized that one of the rare historical monuments of their region was burning down, thirty or so corpses reducing to ash inside.

An alarm rang out far away, which all recognised as the Muggle firefighters.
The protection barriers had fallen with Ratslav Dlavonine's death.
The lights were starting to light up the night, and all sighed.

**"It is time to go,"** Katya declared.
**"Lyvon, go back home and rest.
There will probably be an inquiry of the Aurors today, I will join you tomorrow morning.
Vladmir, Aleksei…
Hogwarts or Kemenov Palace?"**

**"We have obligations in Hogwarts,"** Vladmir mumbled.

**"Really?"** his friend was surprised, as he slightly increased the pressure of the tourniquet on his leg.

**"Unfortunately,"** Vlad sighed.
**"We have an interview with journalists from different countries."**

**"Shit…"**

**"Aleksei!"** his father barked at the swear word, before adding.
**"They must be treated."**

He pointed not only to his son's leg, which looked blackish with dark blood seeping from it despite the tourniquet, but also the large wound that had ripped half of Vladmir's throat.
Only Aleksei's immediate intervention had saved the young heir's life.
The healing spell had prevented his death from hemmorage, but the flesh was still ripped.

**"I doubt the Hogwarts Nurse will be able to heal the children."**

**"Augusta told me the meeting would happen tomorrow morning during the first period, during the Potions class,"** Vladmir said.
**"The day is rising, so I think it will happen in three hours."**

**"Your hand?"**

**"Still attached,"** Vlad mumbled, raising his nearly mummified left hand.

**"Go see Rasputin.
He will patch you up for the morning.
Go see the nurse as soon as this… 'interview' is over,"** Katya ordered.
**"Your mediwizards will be there.
I will tell Augusta."**

The two students agreed and detoured to Saint-Peteresburg's old town before getting to Hogwarts, right on time for the start of class.

**"You look dreadful,"** Kevin declared, waiting for them with their school uniforms and supplies, worry still on his face.
**"But you are here."**

And he hugged his best friend tightly, relieved to see him alive and with all his limbs.
When Katya had announced in the Great Hall the new clan war, all the members of the Aliiance had worried.
A clan war meant a potentially lethal night for their best friend. No one slept, all comfroting each other in the Alliance HQ.

**"Injuries?"**

**"Diverse,"** Aleksei sighed, limping towards the exit of Ravenclaw's Common room.
**"For now, we're patched up, to put in an appearance for the Tournament."**

Kevin slowly nodded and put a hand in his pocket, activating the Alliance's Galleon.
It was time to tell every one that Vlad was alright.

"What do we start with?" Vladmir continued in English.

"Potions, Vlad, we're Monday!
What about you, Aleksei?"

"Defence Against the Dark Arts.
The professor is good, but your spells are so complex!
Seriously, _Bombarda Maxima_?
A simple, powerful **Blow up** has the same effect, no eccentric movement or barbaric words…"

"It's Latin, Aleksei…"

"Exactly, barbari!"

Vlamdir giggled as he left his friend in the Great Hall to go to the dungeons.
he arrived right on time to enter the room with the other students, and all his classmates's gazes stopped a moment on the tick bandage around his throat.

"Will you be able to cut the ingredients?" kevin whispered, as they sat down, poiting to Vlad's scrawny hand.

"I don't thin kso…"

"Hey Vlad, you alright?" Mandy worried, turning towards him.

"You look bad," Anthony, her partner, noted.

"Miss Brocklehurst, Mister Goldstein, silence!" Severus warned.
"We will work on antidotes.
I want you to take great care preparing them, because they might save your lives some day.
Mister Entwhistle?"

"Vladmir will not be able to cut the ingredients.
His hand was injured this weekend."

Professor Prince asked Vladmir to show him his hand, and turned pale at the sight, as did several Slytherins and even a few Ravenclaws when they recognized the curse.
A Hogwarts students had been hit by an old Dark magic spell that provoked a slow mummification of the whole body.

In the silence of the classroom, Severus raised Vladmir's sleeve, who whinced but said nothing.
The parched and mummified aspect of his arm was now stopping at his elbow.

"Did you take the antidote, Mister Kemenov?"

"Not yet, Professor, a family friend is preparing it as quickly as possible," Vladmir sighed, avoiding to say the name of the illustrious Dark mage in front of a full class of Hogwarts students.

"Who cast this spell?" Severus asked threateningly.

"No one in the school, Professor."

Noticing the dark gaze of the Potions Master, he sighed.

"Clan war this weekend," he whispered.

"Linked, I suspect with the murder of the Russian wizard in the Great Hall…
Your aunt is wanted by the Aurors," Severus let him know.

"She will hand herself in to be accountable for her actions and…"

Knocks on the door interrupted them.
A young blond student fearfully passed his head in the door before summoning the courage to go in the room towards Professor Prince.

"Yes, Mister Crivey?" the latter barked, lowering Vladmir's sleeve.

"Sir, I have to bring Vladmir Kemenov to the first floor.
Here is a note from the Headmistress," the young Gryffindor student said.

Severus nearly ripped it in half, visibly angered at the curse on one of his protégés, and quickly read the perfectly calligraphied words of the Longbottom matriarch.

"Take your stuff, Mister Kemenov.
Mister Entwhistle, since you will be alone to do today's potion, you will have an additional quarter of an hour…"

Vladmir closed the door behind him, getting face-to-face withe Crivey.
He remembered his sharp eye that had made a mark on him during his Sorting Ceremony, and he got remembered the boy's first name, a third-year, who had worked with Luna the previous year in the study groups.

"Colin Crivey, is it?"

"Yes!
And you are Vladmir Kemenov, also known as Harry Potter!
Blimey, you are a legend and…"

"Colin," Vlad interrupted him, "don't you have somewhere to lead me to?"

"Oh, yeah!
Come, follow me!"

He quickly climbed the stairs, leading a sighing Russian behind hil.

"Do you know why I need to go to the first floor?"

"All the champions are summoned for a photo shoot and an interview."

"You also take pictures, if I remember correctly," Vlad said nonchalently, amused by the excited attitude of the boy.

"Yes!
I want to be a photographer later!
But how do you know?"

"You have a camera sticking out of your pocket," Vladmir laughed.
"Luna told me that she loved your pictures."

Colin's face lit up as he asked what she had said exactly.

"You capture people's essence.
Even though wizarding photos are alive, she admitted to me that you managed to make already magical pictures even more so.
Coming from such a witch, it is a wonderful praise!"

"I… I…
Ah, it's there," the young Muggle-Born declared sadly, poiting to a door.

"I you really want to become a photographer, ask Luna if she can arrage an intership with her uncle this summer.
Amiphilius is an independant journalist for the international press, and he always needs talented photographers to work with him.

Colin Crivey's gaze lit up again as he thanked Vlad for his adive.
The Russian smiled slightly as he massaged his painful throat now that the calming potions were wearing off.
He hurried to dring one of the dozen antalgic vials that Rasputing had filled his and Aleksei's pockets with, before inhaling and entering the toom.

After he had knocked on the door, he was in a small classroom refitted so that several tables covered in an ecru velvet, were on the platform, in front of around ten seats.
Five other seats were at the tables' ends.
Several people were already there, and he heard conversation coming from another room.

**"Vlad,"** Aleksei said in a tired voice made tense by the pain.

**"Are you alright?"**

**"My leg burns, but it's because it's healing,"** his Russian friend sighed.
**"What about you?"**

**"I'm fortunate to have good Occlumency shields.
Take one of the vials,"** Vlad advised him.

Viktor Krum, who was discreetly listening to them, walked towards them after he saw Aleksei drink a dark green potion.

**"You really look horrendous.
You know your face will appear all over the news?"**

**"I don't worry about that,"** Aleksei sighed.
**"In any case, the journals will probably talke about it tomorrow, so…"**

**"Talk about what?"** Cedric asked, who had decided to learn Russian after his head noticed that all his Alliance friends could speak it fluently.
Contrary to the two Russians, quite pale indeed, their faces tired and tense, a few wounds still visible on them, the Hufflepuff was perfectly refreshed an smiling.

**"The Kemenivs and Vasefine led a clan war tonight against the Dlavoninves,"** Viktor explained.
**"It is a miracle that both are still alive."**

**"We were lucky that the Dlavonine had a serious superiority complex.
They did not think us capable of attacking them following the clan war rules, even if they had Aleksei's two sisters."**

"Seigneur Potter?"

"Yes, _Heretem_ Delacour?" Vladmir politely asked when Fleur Delacour approached them, her Rochefroide teammate behind her.
When he had entered, she was joyfully talking with the other French in the coppetition, distractedly pushing back her hair.
Fortunately, the Rochefroide student seemed immune to the Veela's magical charm.

"I would like to introduce you tou Matthieu Bosquet.
Matthieu, here is Vladmir Kemenov, Prince Potter."

"Your Highness," the French man bowed.
His features were friendly, and his eyes were green and sharp, almost the same colour as Vladmir's
"It is an honour to meet you."

"It is an honour to meet you as well," Vladmir replied amicably.

"I hope you will not take offence, Vladmir, but I do not wish to let you win, even though your could be my kind," the French man said teasingly.

Vlamdir burst out laughing, which made him feel so good after the eventful evening he had lived.
He quickly stopped, however, and coughed at bit as he rubbed his throat, unwittingly getting every one's attention on the thick bandage partially hidden under his uniform.

"No offence take, Matthieu, I sure hope you will not bend over backwards for me.
Our schools are still rivals, and the individual statuses have nothing to do with the current situation," Vladmir continued with a small smile, making them understand that they had better not ask any question on the injuries.

"Great!" Ludo Bagman suddenly exclaimed, appearing behind them.
"Our six champions are talking among each other, such a good proof a fair-play!
Well, now that you are all here, let's get down to business!
The wand examination!
The rest of the jury will be there in just a moment and…
Any problem, Mister Kemenov?"

"The wand examination?" the Russian repeated slowly.

"We have to check that your wands are working perfectly.
They will be your most important instruments to fulfill your tasks!
What would a wizard be without his wand?"

"And afterwards?" Fleur asked softly, as Bagman was getting astounded looks from the foreign students at his completely absurd words.
As he had said, it was a tool, practical, but not essential.
They were still wizards when they had no wand!

"Afterwards, you will be interviewed by several journalists from several periodicals, a press conference to say it simply.
Rita Skeeter for the _Daily Prophet_ and _Witch Weekly_, sorry", Bagman added when the two Hogwarts students whined in despair at the mention of the women's magazine.
"There will also be Amiphilius Lovegood for the _Quibbler_, some David de Raspières for _Le Monde magique_ and Sabine Courtin for _Magie Libre_.
As for our Slavic champions…
The periodicals _Sega Magia_ and _The Red Dawn_ will be represented by Lumi… Luminata Desui and Yascheslaf Oktadeteski."

"Lumino Tiesciu," Viktor corrected him with an amused smile.

"And Vyacheslav Vitalievitch Odkadteski," Vladmir added, laughing despite himself at the atrocious pronounciation of the Head of Magical Games and Sports.
The most famous political chronicler of the _Red Daw_ had a name that was difficult to pronounce for any one who was not Salvic.

"I am glad to hear that you can correctly pronounce my name, your Highness," a corpulant and smiling man declared.
he was followed by the other membersof the jury, as well as various wizards and witches from the different periodicals.
Three wizards armed with cameras were also among them.

"And I am delighted to finally meet such a famous international reporter."

"Flattery is not proper for you, young man."

"I am not flattering you, Odkadteski, I have grown up with a former Auror who because a seasoned politician.
I know how to recognize a competent journalist when I read their articles."

Vladmir looked mockingly at the blonde witch with an atrocious and complex hairdo, wearing a dark pink dress.

"However, I wonder about why a political specialist would cover such an event," Vladmir continued as he saw the blonde witch coming towards them.

"The fact that the Tsesarevitch is participating, and even forced to do so, is sufficient to get me involved.
The political fallout if you died in the tournament would be…"

"Mister Kemenov, could I please have a short conversation with you?" Rita Skeeter suddenly interrupted, getting daggers from all her colleagues.

"But of course…"

"… not," Vladmir stated before Ludo Bagman could end his sentence.
"This is a press conference, Miss Skeeter, not individual interviews."

"But…"

"I am having a conversation with a fellow Russian, you are not invited!" Vlad growled, mvoluntarily thickening the accent.

Behind the British witch, her foreign colleagues quickly hid their amused smiles.
The Daily Prophet's journalist's reputation seemed to have crossed the Channel, and not a glorious one at that.

Before the conversation turned sour, Felix Selwyn intervened and asked for everyone to take their place.
The six champions sat down behind the velvet-covered tables, while the members of the jury were sitting down below them and the journalists comfortably sat down in the chairs they were given.

At this moment, the Headmistress arrived with an old wizard with large pale eyes.

"Let me introduce you to Mister Garrick Ollivander, who will check your wands t oensure they are functional before the tournament."

A few notes and pictures were taken as the man walked to the small space between the jury and journalists.

"Miss Delacour, could you please come here?" he asked amicably, turning to her.

The Veela approached and handed him her wand, which projected a few pink sparks when it arrived in the hands of the wandmaker.

"Twenty-three and three quarters centimetres… very rigid… rose wood and… oh!" Ollivander exclaimed as he stopped turning the magical item between his long fingers.

"A hair from my grandmother," the young woman declared.

"Yes… Léanne is an excellent wandmaker and I admire her work, even though we do not use the same cores.
_Orchideus_."

A beautiful blooming orchid stalk appeared, which he gave Fleur Delacour along with her wand.
All the wizards who knew the language of flowers snorted when she strongly blushed while taking the flower and a few flashes from the photographers rang out.

"It corresponds to your essence, dear," the old wizard teased.
"You wand works perfectly well.
Mister Bousquet?"

The Rochefroide champion stoo up to hand over his wand.

"Still one of dear Léanne's creations…
Twenty-one centimetres… pliant… boxwood… and… oh my… two cores?
Thestral hair and blood?"

"My grandfather's blood, I stopped counting the generations," the French man jeered.

"Vampire?" Ollivander suspected.
"An excellent amplifier, very poserful.
A duelling wand, but it is not surprising for a Rochefroide student…
_Gladuim Lucius_!"

An extremely sharp knife appeared in front of him, before turning it back into its original feather shape.

"In an excellent state.
Mister Diggory?
Ah… I recognise that one, made by my father," Ollivander exclaimed with enthusiams.
"A unicorn hair, a magnificient male, very attached to it…
Thirty and a half centimetres in ash wood, supple…
Excellent state!
You regularly take care of it," the wizard affirmed, making small smoke rings appeared.
"Mister Kemenov?
Or should I say, Mister Potter?"

At the daggers the Russian gave him, garrick olivander sighed and reached out his hand to get Vladmir's wand.

"I was surprised when I did not see you in my humble shop.
After supplying two generations of Potters, I was impatiently waiting for the next one."

"I chose to get it from where all the Kemenovs have bought their wand," Vladmir explained, not handing his wand.

"Mister Kemenov?"

"My wand is protected by specific enchantments, Mister Ollivander.
You won't be able to touch it, and I refuse to lift the spells, because they cost too much energy for me to replace them right now."

"You…"

"Hum… if I may, in Russia, handing out your wand to another person is rare and requires a huge amount of trust," the _Red Dawn_ journalist explained.
"Mister Kemenov's hesitation is perfectly understandable."

"Very well, I will only do a visual analysis," Ollivander sighed.
"Who is the maker?"

"Dinaya Obolovna."

The _Red Dawn_ journalist choked on his drink as Ollivander frowned.

"I do not know this woman.
I thought Gregorovitch was the one supplying the Slavic countries."

"Gregorovitch died before I could get to his shop."

"Obolovna is one of the few wandmakers to create custom-made wands.
She lives in the Russian Far-East, near the Sea of Okhostk," Odkadteski filled in.
"She also supplies of Japanese wizards."

"Hmmm," Ollivander replied.
"It seem of a high quality, although made from surprising parts…
Twenty six centimetres, Japanese larch, with a hyppogriff feather core and… also vampire blood?"

"Great-Uncle on the Kemenov side," Vladmir declared neutrally.

"The Saint-Petersburg Knyaz?" the _Red Dawn_ journalist asked with great interest.

"The Saint-Petersburg Knyaz is an excellent friend, but he did not supply the blood," Vlamdir answered.

"As I unfortunately cannot touch your wand, dear, could you cast a small _Lumosç for me?"

Vlamdir sighed and cast the spell, before returning to his seat.

"Mister Krum?"

The Bulgarian also followed the ceremonial.
Ollivander identified the maker this time, the late Gregorovitch, and determined that it was made of Horbeam, with a core of a dragon's heart nerve.
As small chirping birds sprang from Viktor's wand, he finally called Aleksei, who presented his wand without holding it out, as Vladmir had done previously.

"One of… AAARRGH!"

**"Idiot!"** Aleksei roared, getting his wand back from the hands of the man, who had taken it before Aleksei could prevent it.
**"Doesn't he listen to warnings?"**

Around him, journalists had jumped out of their seats, scratching on their notepads while the photographers were snapping away at Ollivander.
The members of the jury also immediately jumped out, but Aleksei was already kneeling beside the man, who was screaming in pain, his hands half-burned.

**"Aleksei…"** Vladmir yelled.

**"That will teach him a lesson!"** the Russian spat out, looking at the man howling on the ground, before raising his wand, cutting his hand, and spraying the wandmaker with blood.
**"Cancel, by the blood of Aleksei Lyvonovitch Vasefine!"**

The old wizard immediately calmed down, and the burnt marks nearly immediately disappeared.

"When we warned you about not touching the wand of a Russian wizard without his consent, there was a good reason for it," Aleksei said, standing up to look at the journalists.

"You should had told Mister Ollivander," the French witch declared.

"Madame, he knew I am Russian, and Vlamdir had gone before me.
I did not think he would be so stupid as to not make the connection."

And Aleksei returned to seat after casting a blinding _Lumos_ to prove that his wand was perfectly usable.
Only the Slavic journalists saw him whince as he massaged his painful leg and drink a vial of potion.

"Now," Ludo Bagman sighed as Garrick Ollivander was brought to the Hospital Wing.
"Let's get to the questions from the journalists, then we will have a photoshoot.
Ladies first."

"Why are you six champions competing instead of the scheduled three?" the _Magie Libre_ witch asked.

"After the champions were named, a fourth name sprang out of the Goblet of Fire: Vladmir Kemenov."

"Because I am under a magical contract, I cannot withdraw.
To balance out the situation, Lord Rowle asked Durmstrang, Rochefroide and Beauxbâtons to choose a second champion."

"Are they also under a crontract?" Amiphilius Lovegood asked.

"Indeed, we are under the same constraints as the original champions," Aleksei answered.
"The English Ministry quickly drafted contracts based on the one for the Goblet of Fire."

"Who are the true champions?" Rita Skeeter asked avidly.

"There are no true of false champions," Viktor Krum cuttingly declared, after looking at the other students in the room.

"Miss Delacour, how does it feel to be the only woman to compete?" David de Raspières asked.

"I am both flattered and honoured to be the only woman, but I am disappointed at the same time.

"Mister Kemenov, is it true that you have led a clan war this very night against the Dlavonines?" Odkadteski ask out of curiosity, although the answer was obvious from the bandages and the potions the two clan heirs had been discreetly drinking.
They were courageous to face a horde of journalists the morning after an attack.
They had probably not slept, as well.

The fearful jump from Igor Karkaroff at the mention of the Dlavonince was noted by everyone, and Vladmir filed this detail in his mind.

"This question is irrelevant and I will not answer it," the Russian sniffed, before acepting the silent appologetic nod ftom the journalist.

"Have you got a fiancée?
After all, between all your titles and your status as the Boy-Who-Lived…"

The _Daily Prophet_ journalist could not finish her question.
The gaze Vladmir gave her could have been enough to freeze the Black Lake.

"Again, irrelevant question, and inapprorpiate at that.
My private life is not your business, and if I learn that this wonderfull quill," he pointed to the Quick-Quotes Quill, "changed any of my words, you will see what my titles mean on a legal and political level."

The other journalists gave the magical artifact disgusted looks.

"Mister Krum, after your performance at the Quidditch World Cup, do you feel confidant for the Tri-Wizard Tournament?"

"I do.
I do not apprehend them the same way.
Personally, the Tri-Wizard Tournamentis a matter of honour for the school.
Quidditch is something I do for pleasure and challenge."

"Did you know each other before meeting for the tournament?"

"Some of us did," Aleksei replied.
"Vladmir and myself are quasi-neighbours, and we grew up together.
He also knows Cedric, as they are from the same school.
And he had met Viktor during the Flightracing championships and during the World Cup opening."

"You participate to Flightracing events?" Lumino Tisescui wondered.
"Wait… are you _that_ Kemenov?
The madman who proceded to exchange their broom during the World Cup?"

"I am not sure madman is appropriate," Vladmir nuance, "but I am indeed that Kemenov.

"What is Flightracing?" Sabine Courtin, from _Magie Libre_ asked.

"It is a broom race in a natural environment," Fleur Delacour explained.
"It is a very niche sport in France, but I attended this year's Charity Race in Siberia…
It was really breathtaking!"

"Mister Krum is a famous Quidditch champion, Mister Kemenov is a rising star in Flightracing, and I think Mister Diggory is the Captain of Hufflepuff's Quiddtich team.
Miss Delacour, Messers Bousquet and Vasefine, do you have any sporting skills?"

"I am the junior French Duelling champion," Matthieu said with a proud smile.

"And he is excellent at it," Fleur Delacour confirmed.
"I am a lead dancer of the Paris aquatic ballet."

Vlamdir raised a surprised eyebrow.
Aquatic ballet was a true artform, the dancers were moving in a huge room full of water.
It was something full of grace, demanding extreme precision to mange to create precise movement in a totally different environment.
The feeling of gravity nearly disappeared, but the density of water made any movement difficult.
Those ballets were magnificient.
It was like seeing birds fly, but in water.

"I though Veelas were incompatible with water?"

"We are not, you are making an amalgam with our difficulties with sirens.
The fact that we have some rancour against this water people does not make us aquaphobes.

"What about you, Mister Aleksei?"

"I hold the Durmstrand running record… to flee the professors," the Russian joked, making every one laugh.

"He is quite humble, because he does have a reputation at school to be really quick.
One day, one of the Quiddtich guys wanted to find his peak speed.
They started from the same point… and Aleksei nearly reached 100 kph.
He had been nicknamed the Golden Snitch ever since.
Some are still looking for the cause of his… magical speed."

Aleksei blushed at the journalists' laughs.

"So you all have physical abilities, what about your magical talents?" Tisescui continued.

"We are in this tournament to show them", Matthieu laughed.

"Do you think you will get along in each pair?
The contrast between Dark and Light magic is present in each of your teams, will it not generate friction?"

"It won't," Cedric declared, to every one's surprise.
"Because Magic itself is not black, what matters is the intention.
I have spent enough time with Vladmir to understand that.
He is a Dark wizard, uses blood magic, and even sacrifices, but that does not make him evil."

"Durmstrand teaches both types of magic.
I would be a hypocrite if I told Aleksei off for using Dark Magicn when I cast those spells in class."

"I am a Veela.
Some magical societies consider me less than an animal.
Why would I reject a man because of his blood and his preferrential magic?
Indeed, Matthieu had vampire blood in his veins, indeed he uses Dark Magic, but I am not against it."

"As for working together," Viktor continued, "I think we all know our teammate well enough to know what we can and can't do."

This proof of tolerence closed the question and answer section, and after a few photos, they were free to go back to class.

As he chose to go the Alliance HQ to wait for the others before eating, he was surprised to see Sergei and Katya.

**"Weren't you supposed to go to the Hospital Wing to get treated?"** Katya reproached him.

Vladmir swore, having completely forgotten about his hand.
The curse had gotten up to his shoulder, and he was brought to the Hospital Wing, where Aleksei was examined by Madam Pomfrey.

**"You nearly forgot?"** Aleksei sniggered, in his underwear, as the Matron examined his leg.

**"Shut up,"** Vladmir groaned, as the Kemenov madiwitch appeared with Augusta and Rasputin, followed by the Vasefina Mediwizard.

**"The curse has spread a lot since this morning,"** the immortal Dark Mage sighed, examining the mummified arm.
**"I have finished the potion, you will drink it.
Let me warn you, you will sleep very deeply, it will take time to act throughout your body…"**

Vladmit agreed and gulped down the deep blue potion.
He imediately feel into a coma.

He did not see Pomona Pomfrey and his Mediwitch examine him, before they finished healing his throat and the numerous superficial injuries that resulted from the clan war.
Nor did he see Katya sant up after kissing his forehead and surrender to the Aurors, to account for the murder of the Russian wizard.

He did not see Sergei watch over him for the two days of his coma, staying at his bedside, immobile.
Nor did he see his friends visiting one after the other to check in with him.

He only woke up on the third day, face to face with Sergei, half-asleep on a chair next to him.

**"What…"**

He whinced at the pain in his throat and tried to put a hand on it, before starting to panic when he realized that he could not move.

**"Shush… Kitten, calm down.**
Madam Pomfrey, he is awake!

The Matron arrived immediately and reassured Vlamdir.
He could not move because he was still metabolizing the potions in his body.
It would be a few hours before he could move freely.

"My… throat…" Vladmir croaked.

"Mister Kemenov… you nearly got your throat slit, don't wonrder why it hearts after your neck was healed!
I am surprised you managed that press conference," she added dissapprovingly.
"Now, please rest.
Mister Pokhastovine, I count on you to keep him calm."

"Of course, Madam," the Vmapire smiled.

**"Ser… gei…"**

**"Yes, Kitten?"**

**"Ka… tya?"**

**"She managed to prove clan Kemenov's legitimacy for the assassination of the Dlavonine emissary in front of the Russian Justice Court, thanks to the ancient clan laws.
Thanks to the international treaties, she will soon be free from prison.
Lucius can't do much, since he is Minister for Magic.
He's grumbling that he should have waited for a year before overthrowing the Ministry, he could have bribed Fudge."**

**"Tsar?"** Vladmir asked hesitantly.
He had not forgotten the name Slytherin had said, the one of the first dynasty of Tsars, which had reigned for nearly seven centuries on what would becore a part of Russia.

**"No, Kiten.
I was indeed part of the royal Riurikid dynasty, but I was a mere prince, way before the first tsars appeared."**

**"You and H… Helga?"**

**"You didn't forget, did you?"** the vampire sighed.

Vladmir gave him a pleading look, and Segei sighed again before telling his story.

**"I was transformed nearly a thousand years ago.
To tall you the truth, I don't remember when exactly, it's starting to be too far…
I met Helga Hufflepuff when I was stil lhuman.
She was travelling Europe to learn new forms of magic wuth the Other founders, and they had ended up in my country.
It was way before the foundation of the school, when they were still apprentices.
They arrived in the city of Skidlav…
It was not in Russia yet, only a Slavic kingdom named Novgorod.
I was the cousin of the king of this small province, and as such, I was habilitated to welcom hihg-ranking guests.
Helga and her friends were supposed to stay only a few days, but days became weeks, then months…
We learned to know each other, and love each other…
We were going to marry, when I was forcefully transofrmed by Dimitri Pokhastovine.
I only could get free from his grasp after two centuries, and she had long been dead by the."**

Vladmir stayed silent at the news.
It explained Helga's tears and the rencour from the other Founders.
THey had thought for a millenium that Helga Hufflepuff had been nearly abandonned at the altar!

**"I had a son,"** Sergei eventually whispered.

**"Come… again?"** Vladmir said.

**"I had a son…
I have descendants…
This other tepestry in the Crypt…"**

**"They… still… Bri… tain?"**

Sergei nodded.

**"My granddaughter is a formidable witch, and I am not even mentionning her grandson,"** the vampire smiled softly.
**However, I will have to ask Grigori for help with her son and his wife."**

Vladmir burst out laughing when he realized who his descendants were.
Life was full of irony.
