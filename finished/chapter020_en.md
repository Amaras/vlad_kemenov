## Chapter 20: Discussion between friends

Ravenclaws had a line of conduct.
The Three Bronze Rules of study -- _always be on time_, _always turn in homework on time_, _help each other_ -- to which were added the Four Azure Rules that dictated their behaviour during the Sorting Ceremony.
Every first year had to learn how to behave for the next year's banquet.
It was a matter of their House's honour, and all followed the Rules.

_Stay silent_.
Once the newcommers came into the Great Hall, all eagles had to shut up and stay silent in all circumstances.

_Politely applaud_.
Even if they didn't like them.
Even if they didn't like a family in particular.
Even if they weren't sorted into their House.
Everyone deserved at least the minimum of respect.
It was inconceivable that the eagles would stood so low as to boo or smear someone they didn't know.

_Have an examplary behaviour_.
For all Ravenclaws, it included their bearing and expressions.
This evening was the first year's first impression, the eagles had to be perfect.

_Do NOT participate to the stupid Hogwarts song_.
Not that the Ravenclaws disliked the idea.
All Hogwarts students from all Houses doing something united for a change...
No, what displeased the eagles were the ridiculous lyrics that were an aberration and an insult to their intelligence.
Undeniably, it was Vladmir's faourite rule, as he had been traumatised in his first year.

Those four welcome rules were responsible for their reputation for being uptight, but also for being greatly tolerant.

It was thus that the perfectly calm eagles' table looked at the young ones enter.
Slytherin's and Ravenclaw's stoicism, that was contrasted by Hufflepuff's and Gryffindor's good mood.

Minerva McGonagall, after the standard Sorting explanation, called for the students one by one, a good forty-or-so children.
Following their rule exactly, the Ravenclaws all politely applauded the new students, applauding new eaglets slightly louder, however.

Vladmir, for his part, was carefully observing the newcommers.
Three of them had caught his attention.
A smiling short boy, whom Vlad had seen the gaze analyse every nook and cranny of the Great Hall.
He was convinced that this Colin Crivey, newly Gryffindor and probably Muggle-born, would be able to tell him about any slightly significant event of the night if he asked him.
Vladmir only knew three people with this kind of gaze.
One was one of the most famous freelance reporters in the United States, the second was an infamous Russian spy, and the third was the craziest but most brilliant English journalist he had the pleasure to meet.

The second pupil that interested him had a lost and dreamy gaze.
However, when Luna Lovegood sat down at the far end of the table, her gaze pierced the depths of his soul.
Keeping silent as the Azure Rules dictated, Vlamdir gave her a warm smile and nodded at her to welcome her, while Kevin winked at her with an amused look, and put a finger on his lips.
The new Ravenclaw let out a small cristalline laugh before imitating her elders and watching the last students.

Vlamdir put his attention back on the last student to intrigue him.
A readhead, obviously Ginerva Weasley, last born of a big family.
She had looked at him strangely, her eyes shining with a mix of adulation and weariness, which he did not like one bit...
He understood her being weary of him, but adulation was a mark of fanaticism that could be problematic.
Unsurprisingly, she was sorted into the same House as all her brothers.

As the Hall applauded the last Weasley, Vladmir focused his attention on the Hufflepuff table.
Susan Bones was laughing with her best friend Hannah Abbot, a young blonde girl.
They were chatting animatedly with their new Housemates.
Hufflepuff knew how to be welcoming.

Thoughtful, he was wondering what her bahaviour at the station entailed.
The niece of the Head of the Department of Magical Law Enforcement had blushed when he had looked at her, before nevously smiling at them and going back to her friends.
She had seemed to be surprised by her own intervention and had practically fled.
However, the hard had been done, he had noticed her.
Hannah saw him looking at them and gently nudged her readhead friend.
Susan immediately blushed again and tried to drown herself in her pumpkin juice when her and Vladmir exchanged a look.

Vladmir raised a perplexed eyebrown to Hannah.
They did not know each other well, not having exchanged more than a couple courteous words during their common lessons.
To his utmost surprise, the blonde blushed herself and hesitently smiled at him.

'What on earth is going on?' Vlad wondered, helping himself to porridge, ignoring the cries of wonder of the new students when the plated appeared in front of them.
He briefly thought that this could be linked to Amelia Bones asking to meet him...
Before chasing this thought from his mind as not probable.

"I think you caught some Hufflepuffs' eyes!" his favourite Prefect said amusingly, as he was only a few people from the group of the small group of second-years.

At his side, Kevin choked on his drink and enlegantly spat it out at Lisa, who let out a disgusted exclamation as she leaned forward under the table.
It was good for her, as she avoided most of the spray, while much laughter resounded at the Ravenclaw table.
Numerous students watched in dismay, as they had never seen the serious and uptight eagles laugh out loud, especially at the welcoming banquet!

"Nice reflexes," Micheal complimented her, as Lisa poked her head from under the table to see if Kevin was not laughing any more.

"[Caliganguis] have left your mind, but Nargles are twirling around you."

_[Caliganguis]_? _Twirl_? _Nargles_?

Vlad turned his head to look at the dreamy girl.
Luna Levegood gave him a lost smile that Vlamdir guess was a sign of her nervousness, and he was her become stiffer as all who heard her turned to see her.

"Are ou Xenephilius Levogood's daughter?" Vlad asked.

Once again, he saw the nearly unnoticeable tension as she nodded.
Pensively, he watched her chat with two girls around her.
Lovegoods were known for their excentricity, and the girl seemed cut from the same cloth as the twins.
Vlad had met Amiphilius, Luna's uncle, a man with a tint of both madness and genius in his eyes.
Lovegoods were undeniable excentric, but they were geniuses, each in their own right.
The twins were both excellent journalists.
Katya had introduced Amiphilius to him when they went to a journalism congress in France.
She was his correspondant for Russian affairs, and Katya, when she deigned to work in international journalism, only worked with the best, Kemenov pride obliges.
Vladmir had also heard about [Elena Rosier-Lovegood], a quircky but talented Potions Mistress, who had unfortunately died in an accident...

Luna seemed used to being mocked, seeing the way the new eaglets were mocking here without her seeming to care about it.
And he was not the only one to see that.

"Hey, Bradley," Kevin suddenly said, catching the higher years' attention.
The Prefect and the closest Ravenclaw curiously looked at the young eagle, who slightly nodded towards Luna.
Their elders immediately seemed disappointed by what they saw.

Thus, as Dumbledore was rising up to say his welcoming speech, Kevin nodded encouragingly at Luna, who was neglected at the far end of the table.

"Hey miss, come this way!" the Muggle-born exclaimed warmly, moving away from Vlad to make room between them.

Vladmir looked daggers at the Headmaster, inviting him to say anything as Luna, in the silence of the Great Hall, was hesitantly moving places.
He saw Dumbledore clench his jaws, his gaze frankly evil for a fraction of a second, before he took back his grandpa looks.

"Now that we have all eaten well..." Vlad distractedly looked at his cold porridge... "I have to remind you about some rules, including the entry into the Forbidden Forest is, as the name implies, strictly forbiden.
Yes, yes, Mr and Mr Weasley, I reapeat myself each year, but you seem to be in need of a reminder more than once a year!"

Micking whistles rose up from Gryffindor table as the twin stood up, a falsely offended look on their face, claiming their innocence on all counts.
Dumbledore waited for calm to come back.

"Please note that the curfew is still in place, and that this year, more severe sanctions will be taken against rule breakers.
In another note: the technical incident at King's Cross station is currently under investigation.
About thirty of you all were unable to catch the Hogwarts-Express this year.
Your parents will thus receive information up until the investigation has ended.
Finally, following the sad loss of Professor Quirell...

'Sad?
This bastard had not dared lying about the Death Eater's death, had he?'
Vladmir cast a glacial glance Ã  the headmaster, as Kevin put a hand on his arm.

"Calm down Vlad...
Your magic is leaking," his friend whispered.

Vladmir slowly breathed in, then put his attention on the newly-presented professor.
He grimaced out of disgust, a disgust equally directed at the students, the headmaster, and the blond man who was hypocritically smiling at the professoral table.
Why were all girls -- even first-years -- sighing enamouredly or clucking like turkeys?
Why had this bloody headmaster hired a successful authors who was as qualified as a [Blast-ended Skrewt]?
Why the hell had he lied about Quirell's death?

'Merlin's sake, even Hermione seemed under his charm!' Vlad realised as he exchanged a horrified look with Neville.
You just had to look at his sly smile...
He was definitely cursed.

"The curse..." Luna whispered, as in a daydream, making the Russian jump.
Was she reading in his mind?

"Curse?" Padma exclaimed, looking at the young Ravenclaw between Vlad and Kevin.
There were only six new eaglets this year, the lowest in 50 years.

"Wh-What curse?" Lisa stuttered.

"The one in which DADA profesors only stay for one year," Teddy whispered in response.

"We'll have to change it. Only one year _and_ incompetent," Vladmir groaned.
"After the stuttering bald one, the brainless blonde..."

"Why do you say that, Vlad?
I read all of Lockhart's books, he did incredible things!" Sue, another girl from his year whom he finds hard to bear, raved.
Mandy vigorously nodded to show her support.

Vladmir grinned mockingly, but did not try to contradict her.
He did not want to alienate Padma or Mandy and her sharp tongue.

Finally, the headmaster announced a song -- _the_ song -- and the Ravenclaws all grimaced.
The eaglets, surprised earlier by the little notes their elders gave them discreetly before, saw the students from all Houses rise up and starting to sing the Hogwarts hymn.
Well... all Houses...
Slytherins were showing good faith for once and their lisps were vaguely moving.
However, Gryffindors and Hufflepuffs were more than enough to compensate for the two silent tables.
As was the case at the start of his first year, Vlad was starting to feel a headache coming due to the overwhelming sound, and only felt relief when the song, as well as teh banquet, ended.

'Finally free!' Vladmir and Kevin quickly stood up, ready to go to their common room.
Bradley's and Flitwick's speeches to the first-years were waiting for them, and they would probably be interesting.
They guessed they would be about tolerance, judging from the thoughtful look the Prefect gave Luna.

"Kemenov, Entwhistle!"

"Malfoy," Vlad distractedly greeted him, as a sobbing Pansy Parkinson passed them by, accompanied by Bulstrode.
"You finally took care of the problem?
Congratulations."

"Yes, I did," Draco smiled.
"Our engaement has been cancelled, even if mother was against that.
Fortunately, father did not take her opinion into account."

Vladmir smiled back at his friend, and they agreed to meet back the next day in their room.
Draco would tell their two lions, as Slytherins surely had a common lesson with Gryffindors.

---

The lessons started back, and routine did with them.
That was what Vlad had hoped, at least...
Everything started by Herbology and it was a catastrophy as usual.
He definitely did _not_ have a green thumb, but fortunately Neville was here to save him from a particularly persistant root.
Kevin has fallen over in laughter when he saw the plant bite his best friend, who had jumped all over the place, begging to Neville to get this thing off him, his status as a noble totally forgotten.

If it were jsut that!
Just as they had arrived in front of the greenhouses, they had the displeasure of seeing Gilderoy Lockhart.
Boasting as ever, he claimed to advise the Herbology professor on how to take care of one of the trees in the grounds.

Vladmir sniffed mockingly, something that only the target missed?
Who did he think he was fooling, draped in his expensive, spotless, turquoise robes when Professor Sprout was covered in dirt and visibly furious?
It seemed to nontheless apeased her, as she gave him a thankful smile.
Until the man asked to speak with him, _Harry Potter_.

The wave of fury exploded several pots around the Russian, and Vlad could have murdered him there and then if a ferm voice did not intervend, despite Kevin, Neville and Hermione all deperately trying to calm him down.

"Mr _Kemenov_ has a lesson with me Gilderoy," Sprout said vehemently, insisting on his last name.
"If you want to chat with him, please refrain from doing so in my greenhouses and during my lessons.

On this, she shamelessly pushed the man out of her classroom, leaving a streak of dirt on the turquoise robes.
It was Valdmir's turn to smile at his professor while Lockhart yelped about the dirt on the fabric, walking away with a ridiculous swish of his cape.
You eitehr have class, or you don't, and the latter applied to the new hire.

Next were two hours of Transfguration with his nemesis, the surly McGonagall.
Fortunately, thanks to all the work he put into this subject in the summer, he was slightly better and even managed to do the transfiguration before the class ended, getting only a sniff, but no comment, at the button still endowed with scarab antennas and small legs.

Potions happened in a gloomy silence.
Severus Snape was particularly vindicated after a two-hour class with fourrh-year Gryffindors and Slytherins, in which the two Weasley twins, apparently, happened to make their cauldron explode, splashing every single student and making their skin a phosphorescent blue.
He was thus particularly vile and heinous, giving them a complex homework for the following week...

Thus, particularly on edge, Vladmir and Kevin came to the Tutoring club's room.
Fortunately, they had not got the narcissistic blond doll that pretended to be their Defence Against the Dark Arts professor yet.
No, that was for Tuesdays and the last spot on Fridays, just to finish the week on a positive note!

To their surprise, when they came to their room, they noticed they were not the first ones there.
Hermione and Neville were already there.
The Pure-Blood was looking at the young girl turn around the room like a lioness in a cage, walking back and forth on the rug bearing Hogwarts' coat-of-arms.
One needed only see her eyes, which were normally a hazel colour, but now were a frightening black, as well as her magic making here hair hover in all directions to understand that she was seething.
Dozens of objects were flying around her.
She was mumbling acerbic words between, nearly whisting through her teeth.

"I did not think she was this powerful," Neville declared conversationally when the two Ravenclaws sat down next to her to observe the spectacle.

"What made her this mad?" Kevin asked, leaning away from the path of a chandelier that was stuck in the maelstrom around Hermione.

She was indeed not very prone to anger.
They had never seen her this way, and that was really impressive.
She had already destroyed half of the room, and they had protected themselves behind a magical shield just in time to avoid a seat.
They agreed to keep the shield up.

"We'll wait for Draco."

They thus looked at their friend in silence, waiting for their last companion who arrived not much later, to their relief.
Hermione did not seem to calm down, quite the contrary.
The bench they were sitting on was shaking, seemingly wanting to join the shards of the furniture twirling around her.
Tables and chairs had long exploded under the magical power.

"Well, I didn't know Granger had predispositions for Dark Magic," Draco declared as he sat down himself, getting inside the protection dome.
He had smiled, amused, when he noted the dark aura of Hermione's magic.
"What made her this mad?" he continued.

"McGonagall."

"What did this old goat do again?" Vlad growled.

"She dissolved our club. Apparently on a direct order from the headmaster," Neville answered.

"What?" Vlad roared, jumping on his feet himself.
It was way too much for him today.
Under the others' mocking eyes, he joined Hermione in her walk, swearing in Russian and mumbling crude and dark words.
They listened carefully to hear the sentences the two furies were saying, only to hear that both their ideas were nearly identical.

"I'm going to gut him slowly, make him eat his beard..."

"... Eat her chignon... Fucking cat..."

"... Manipulating bastard with disgusting robes...

"... Racist, intolerant House..."

Kevin could not take it any more and howled with laughter when their bench, under the effort of both of the student's magic, started hovering, catching the three students with it.

"What?" they spat out at the same time.

Neville and Draco could not help but laugh as well when both Vlad and Hermione turned to them at the same time, with the same fury shining in their equally black eyes.

After a few seconds, Vlad and Hermione were able to calm down, and the other three could land back on the ground, while all miraculously intact objects went back to their own spots.
A few flicks ofD Draco's and Neville's wands, and the room took back its initial appearance, without any trace of magic.

"Please explain what happened, Neville," Kevin smiled as they all sat down around their favourite table.
He prefered asking the vice-president because the pres... ex-president was still seething.

"McGonagall summonned us at noon.
The headmastered disallowed our club because it has students from other Houses than Gryffindor."

"He can't!" Kevin protested.
"The school's rules are clear: forming a club strictly for the benefit of a single House is forbidden!
That's abuse of his authority."

"Absolutely.
And he has breached his duties as Headmaster.
Our club was under the student secrecy law.
He had no right to use our nae, and thus our Houses," Vlad spat out.

"I told McGonagall," Hermione mumbled, "but the decree has already been ratified.
We're forbidden from reforming a club."

"Well, let's do a secret society!"

All turned to Kevin with wide eyes.

"Pardon?"

"Yeah, since we can't exist as a club let's become an illegal group," the Muggle-born innocently smile.
"Like the Illuminati or the Free-Masons!"

"That's a bit too much, Kev," Hermione chuckled.
"Those are two of the biggest global secret societies."

"Don't know them," Draco said in a drawling voice.

"Muggle secret societies."

"Oh ! that's why!" the Slytherin said with a smile.

Neither him not Hermione saw the embarassed look on the face of the two member of the Mirage Court.
However, Kevin caught it, and he pouted in response.

"You don't like my idea, do you?" he sniffled.

"We like the idea, not the status," Vlad whispered.
"In the magical world, this kind of organasation implied an oath of membership, and we can't take this oath."

"Why?" Hermione asked, curious.

Neither answered.
They simply could not as they already took an exclusive oath.
They belonged to the Mirage Court.
Any other magical oath could kill them, except if they were members of a triad, and they were not.

After trying to suck the reasons out of Vlad and Neville, the other three finally let it go, understanding there would be no answer for now.

"In any case, the first class with Lockhart was horrible," Hermione sighed to restart conversation and lessen the tension in the air due to their two friends' secrets.
I thought it would be amazing considering what he has done, but..."

Vlad and Neville both groaned mockingly at the same time.

"Frankly, Mione, you read those book," the Gryffindor whispered. "Compare his vampire stories to Sergei.
Do you imagine him eating _salad_?
Chlorophyll is toxic to vampires, you could find it in any _good_ DADA textbook!
You can see immediately that he's an imposter."

"What?" Draco nearly chocked.

"This man is an usurper," Vlad confirmed.
"His specialty is memory charms.
In some circles, he's known to steal facts and stories from others and take them for himself.
He would have been a brilliant Obliviator if he did not want glory at any cost.

"Wait, how to you know that?" Kevin asked, suspicious.

Neville swore while standing up, which made Vlad chuckle a bit, as Neville started walking back and forth on the rug, just like Hermione and Vlad had before.

"So it's your turn now?" Hermione said with a laugh, quickly joined by the others.

"Nev..."

Both heirs looked at each other, then nodded.
They could not hide their secrets indefinitely, especially now that they hard blurted out this part.
Suddenly serious, they turned to their friends, their wands in hand.
They were not threatening, but that made their friends understand that the matter was more serious than they had previously thought.

"What we are about to tell you necessitates a wizarding oath," Vladmir whispered.
"Swear on your magic that you will never talk about any of what you will discover, in any way."

"Or what?" Hermione softly asked.

Neville pointed his wand to her head.
It was obvious that he did not like what he was doing, but his hand was firm and his face was expresionless.

"Memory charm."

Draco was the quickest, proving his absolute confidence in his friends.
He was used to magical oaths, contrarily to the two Muggle-borns, as he had seen them happened multiple times.

"I, Draco Lucius Malfoy, swear on my life and my magic never to reveal to a third person any secret reavealed today September second 1992 by Vladmir Vassilievitch Kemenov and Neville Franck Longbottom."

A blood-red thread formed at the point where he had put his wand.
Dark red runes appeared, a symbol of his blood oath, and created a bracelet-like tatoo around his wrist.

After some hesitation, Hermione and Kevin did the same, using a similar formulation.
Once the oaths were taken, Draco opened his mouth to ask for complements, but he was cut out by Neville.
The Gryffindor stood up and was starting to trace complex patterns with his wands, turning around the room while whispering complicated formulas.

"What..."

"He's casting a _Fidelius_ Charm," Vlad said with a smile, surprised bu admirative.
"He's really gifted!"

"The _Fidelius_ Charm...
I have heard of that," Hermione whispered, as she watched her friend become inscreasingly pale while he continued his incantations.

"It's a spell designed to protect a secret in a unique being's core.
The piece of information is hidden inside a chosen living person, the Secret Keeper.
Spying spells will be impossible to cast and maintain.
It's a very advanced magic..." the Malfoy heir explained, astounded, as Neville was finishing the cast.

Vladmir, who had stood up, caught his friend as he nearly fell down and helped him sit down.

"That was reckless of you," he whispered. "Your power..."

"It's okay," Neville whispered back with difficulty.
"I'm just completely drained."

Neville indeed had just just virtually all his magic on the charm.
At this point was was basically indistinguishable from a Squib, and he sighed when Vladmir put his hand over his temples, transfering some of his own magic.

"In any case, I could never have done it," the Russian told him, conjuring a glass of water.

Neville eagerly drank, still as pale and with his face covered in sweat, before putting his head on the table.

"How are we called," the lion asked, exhausted, "now that the club has been dissolved?"

They did not take long to chose their new name.
_The Alliance_.
Simple, short, in their image, and totaly true.
They were an alliance of all social classes: nobility, working class with Kevin and his miner father, and middle class, with Hermione's parents who were dentists.
They were an alliance of all blood purity degrees: Pure-Blood, Half-Blood, Muggle-Born.
And they were an alliance of three our of four Houses.

"The Alliance headquarters is located in room 278 of the second wing of Hogwarts' west wingg," Neville whispered to his friends, transmitting them the secret of the room's location.
They may have been dissovled, but this room was still theirs, whatever happened, and they could now chat their without fear.

Vladmir then started to reveal the truth to them.
On them, their families, their belonging to the magical mafia.
He tool the time to describe their hierarchy and the multipolar nature of the Court.

Indeed, the Mirage Court was composed of numerous independant Courts.
Each were led by a leading trio, called Triad.
Some families, like the Kemenovs or the Longbottoms, formed Clans, and were fundametally loyal to their Court; they had present in the underground world for generations.
They formed so-called Master dynasties, infamous and respected in their area, often with a specific expertise, generally associated with the three large classes: Mercenary, Smuggler, Politician.

"What are your domains of expertise?" Hermione asked.

Under their curious, but neither disgusted or horrified, gaze, Neville continued, still half-lying on the table, a smile of relief on his face.

"I'm going to be an assassin, currentyl still learning, as was my father, my grandmother, and my great-grandmother.
My status fits inside the Mercenary class.
Vlad...
Vlad is a Prince of the Eastern Europe Court.
He's a Politician."

"Now, it's only Russia," the Russian reminded him.
"The Eastern Europe Court exploded at the same time as the USSR."

They had to explaine that some people were raised to become future leaders.
They had the title of Prince, and they had to be initiated very early.
Initaition... Candidates to a spot in the Mirage Court had to fulfill a mission linked to their talents.
Vladmir had killed Gregorovitch and created the staging to remind the world what happened to traitors.
Neville had to poison a former undersecretary of the English Ministry for Magic.

"So you're active members of the Mirage Court," Draco concluded, with surprise and admiration.
Without knowing it, he had answered one of Vlad's interrogations.
Draco Malfoy did not know about his father's implication in the _Underground_, England's Mirage Court.

"It's... awesome," Kevin raved, stars shining in his eyes.

Hermione had a more mixed opinion, but she admitted that she was intrigued rather than horrified, like she would have thought a few months before.
She knew Vlad, Sergei, Neville, Mrs. Longbottom...
They were not bad people, only members of a parallel world that was darker and organised by its own rules.
Now that she knew, Hermione understood the difference between their Neville's behaviour, and the cover he had every day.
She understood Vladmir's temper...

"Does that mean Katya...
She's a Triad for Russia, isn't she?"

Vladmir smiled and nodded.
At this point Draco, who was sitting next to him, became pale.

"Vlad...
I heard my parents talk this summer.
Mother was yelling at Father, reproaching him his lack of implication in the Triad...
Is my father a member of the Mirage Court?"

"Draco," Vladmir sighed, passing a hand in his long hair.
"It is not for me to explain that to you...
Talking about your mother, I ran into her in Russia.
She ran away from me, by the way."

"My mother?
Impossible," Draco said categorically.
"She was at the Mauxfois's, the French branch of my family!
Her house elves can confirm.
Dobby and Felkis accompanied her."

Vladmir jumped up and grabbed his friend's tie.

"Dobby, did you really say Dobby?"

"Er... Yeah, I did, why?" the young Malfoy nearly chocked.

"A freking house elf named Dobby, with an English accent, introduced himself into my personal appartments", Vladmir said, his voice as cold as ice.
"If it's the same Dobby, then your mother is not a saint, and is preparing something bad, very bad."

"Why not his father," Kevin whispered.
"Isn't he the Death Eater?"

Vlamdir groaned.
He did not think that Lucius Malfoy was responsible for dangerous events targetting Hogwarts.
Not when he had preferred dissolving the _Underground_ rather than giving it to a madman.
Not when Jealing had warned him about the wife and no the husband.
Succubusses were demons, but they never lied.

"I can call him, if you want," Draco hissed, slightly distressed by the his friend's expressionless face and black eyes.
He had his war mask on, and it was not a good sign.

"Hum... gonna be hard," Neville whispered, still lying on the table, half sleeping despite the situation.
He had to admit that Vladmir's freezing aura was not helping him.
" _Fidelius_ "...

"We can get out", Hermione said, before looking at the time.

"Yeah, I was starting to get hungry anyway," Kevin declared.

"Good... Mione? You alright?"

"Guys, it's two in the morning."

"We're dead," Kevin moaned while letting his head fall on the table, joining Neville.

"We just have to not get caught," Vladmir sneered.
"After all, we have just broken half the school rules with the _Fidelius_.
Getting caught for a simple walk out of the dormitories is basically nothing."
