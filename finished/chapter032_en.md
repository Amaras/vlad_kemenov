## Chapter 32: The Chamber of Secrets

Narcissa Malfoy was standing in front of her son, looking the young Slytherin up and down.
Even her face, usually as expressionless as any respectable Pure-Blood's would be, showed revulsion at Draco's sight.

"You will always aver be good for nothing, my son.
I am ashamed to have birthed you, and I regret that this Bludger did not kill you!"

Draco shivered at the brutal words.

"Have you never loved me, mother?" the young boy painfully aksed.

"Love you?
I merely did my marital duty and gave the noble and powerful House of Malfoy a heir.
Why would I love you?
You are nothing to me, Draco Lucius Malfoy."

Draco screamed as he sat up and immediately huddled up against the bedhead, crying.
He started to sway, staring into space, his mother's harsh words on repeat in his head.

"Draco?
Oi, Draco," a small voice whispered next to him.

Draco did not really react, simply putting his head into his arms to cry more.

Theodore awkwardly tried to make him talk, then looked at Blaise next to him.
Draco's scream woke both of them up, while Crabbe and Goyle were still peacefully sleeping.
Although even an explosion could not move those two.
It was not a situation the SLytherins knew how to handle, their pain and suffering usually hidden deep in themselves.

"I will fetch Profesor Prince," Blaise sighed, as Theo tried to calm down their friend with awkward gestures.
The Slytherin sliently got out of his dormitory and took the hallway to the common room.

The room was gloomy at this time of night, and had turned greenish with the light from the Black Lake's glowing algae.

Used to this ambiance, Blaise went to a portrait and brushed the empty frame ornamented with snakes.
An old severe-looking witch immedately arrived, frowning.

"What is it my boy?" she asked with a suprising gentleness, considering her appearance.

"Draco Malfoy is having a sort of panic attack, we don't know why.
Could Professor Sna...
Sorry, Professor Prince come please?"

"Stay here, I will fetch him for you."

Blaise stood in front of the portrait and only moved a few minutes later, when it pivoted to let a perfectly awake Severus Prince come in, smelling like potions herbs.
Blaise briefly wondered if he slept at all, explaining the problem to his Head of House.

"Thank you, Mister Zabini, I want you to immediately fetch Mr. Kemenov in Ravenclaw common room.
Tell him Lucius is needed in Hogwarts immediately."

"Er... Sir, I don't know where the Ravenclaw common room is, nor how to enter.
And... and parents cannot come in the school without the Headmaster approval," Blaise added after a hesitation.

Severus, who was about to enter the second-year dormitories, stopped and had a side smile.
Blaise slighly stepped back, knowing the Potions Professor's smiles were never a good sign.

"Mister Zabini, what the Headmaster does not know cannot harm him.
The Ravenclaw common room entry is on the floor just above us, behind the eagle statue.
It will ask you a question.
Only answer _Prior Auctoritate_.
You schoolmate's name will be on one of the doors of the corridor underneath the walkway of the common room.
And Mr. Zabini, it you hear any strange noise, stay immobile and do not look up."

Blaise paled as he remembered the monster that roamed the corridors, before nodded in running in the given direction.
Finding the statue was easy, and he frowned when the eagle turned its head to him.

"From four legs, I then have two, then three.
What am I?"

Blaised opened his eyes wide.

"That's the password to enter in their common room, answering a riddle?
I don't have time, _Prior Auctoritate_!"

The statue slid away to reveal a magnificent room, and Blaise admired the place for a few seconds, before remembering why he was there.
The walkway...
He immediately saw the arches under which dozens of doors ran.
He immediately got in the corridor and walked door to door until he found the plaque.

_Enthwistle - Kemenov_

Blaise knocked on the door, which nearly immediately opened on Vlad, still wearing his uniform.

"Zabini?
Why are you here?" Vlamdir frowned.
"It's two in the morning!"

"You are not sleeping."

A mere observation, from his day clothes, but Blaise saw the young Russian's face harden.

"Not your problem.
Why are you here?" he repeated

"Excellent question.
How did you get in here Mr. Zabini?"

Blaise jumped as he looked at Professor Flitwick behind him.
The short Professor could have been amusing, with his nightcap and nightgown assorted to the colours of his House.
However, his mortally serious face ad his wand flippantly held in his hand and pointed at Blaise dissuaded him from thinking about laughing.

"Professor Prince gave me the emergency password to contact Vladmir."

"Why?"

"Draco Malfoy is not good, and Vlamdir needs to call for Mr. Malfoy."

"Mr Kemenov?" Professor Flitwick asked.

"It is alright Professor, I am on it.
Zabini, stay here."

And Vladmir shut the door in his face, making sure Blaise could not look inside.
No way he would let him see Riddle's diary on his desk, not the Dark Magic artefact that stopped the magical fumes from the Horcrux.

He went to Kevin's bed, where André softly snored, Fawkes fast asleep in the small cavity in the Sorting Hat.
To make the scene perfect, Sasha had coiled on the phoenix's neck to stay warm.

"Guys," she whispered softly, shaking André awake to wake up Fawkes as well.

"S'happening?" André mumbled.

Vladmir softly brushed Fawkes's silky feathers, who cooed in bliss and turned around on the Sorting Hat, as Sasha lazily poked her tongue out to ask him to shut up and sleep like any civilized human would at this time of night.

"I am a barbarian, you know that dear," Vladmir smiled.
"Fawkes, I need your help."

"S'time?" the venerable artefact grumbled, Fawkes adding a tired tremolo, not even opening an eye.

"Yes.
Draco is not well, I would like you to fetch Lucius, please.
I promise you I'll massage you in exchange."

It was enough for the phoenix.
Vlamdir had discovere that the magical bird loved to get his wings coddled, and did not hold back on negociating favours.
Fawkes disappeared in a small jet of flames and immediately came back.
Vladmir held back a smile seeing Lucius Malfoy fall down on the ground with a loud crash as the bird returned on André.

The Lord swore as he jumped up, his wand pointed out, and his silk pillow still in his arms.
Vlamdir raised an eyebrown when he saw the long blond hair ruffled and pillow marks still on his cheek and bare chest.

"Was my aunt with you?" Vladmir asked, amused.

"You are too young for those questions," the Lord groaned, realising that not threat awaited him.

He did his hair with a movement of his want, before Transfiguring his pillow into a shirt, then his slik pyjama bottoms into elegant darted trousers.

"What is going on and where am I?"

"Hogwarts.
Seems like a problem with Draco," Vladmir tersely answered.

Lucius did not ask anything more.
Blaise, whom Flitwick had left to go back to sleep, saw Draco's father get out less than two minutes after Vladmir had shut the door in his face.
Astonished, he stared at the Lord passing in front of him in the most casual outfit, without any robes or jacket.

"Not a word Zabini," Vladmir gowled, following Lucius out of his room, Sasha coiled around his arm under her bracelet appearance.

"What... What was Lu...
Lucius Malfoy doing in your room," Blaise stuttered, in shock.

Vladmir did not respond, and followed Lucius to the dungeons.

He was about to enter the Slytherin common room when the young Russian froze.
His wand got into his hand as he recognised the caracteristic sound of Parsletongue.

"In, now," he yelled as the furious hisses grew.

Blaise, frozen, stayed immobile at the vision of the threatening young Russian.

"Fuck, Zabini, move!"

Vlad pushed the Slytherin inside the common room and threw himself after him.
He head a thud against the closed portrait and clenched his teeth, fuming.

"Vladmir?"

"Go back to sleep," the Kemenov heir growled.

Blaise did not make him repeat and ran to his dormitory, as Lucius stared at the young boy whose eyes had nearly turned to black in anger.

"You frightened him, Vladmir," the Lord declared.
"Do you know you are litterally seating Dark Magic?"

Vlamdir did not give him any attention, fully turned towards the door to the Slytherin common room.
He did not react when a new thud shaked the portrait, while Lucius jumped.

"Go see Draco.
I think he has a hard time accepting Narcissa's situation..."

"Vladmir,...
What is there outside?" Lord Malfoy asked, worried.

"A Basilisk."

"Linked to Narcissa?"

"Among other things..."

Vlamdir heard Lucius leave and he frowned.
He had to find a way to destroy this bloody Horcrux, find the entry of the Chamber of Secrets, and get rid of this Basilisk before someone died.
They had been lucky till then, but it could not last forever.

The young Russian closed his eyes and opened his ind to search for a specific presence.
After feeling around for a bit, he percieved André and immediately, him and Fawkes appeared on his head, as usual.

"Sassly is at the door?" André wondered as a new thud rang out.
"She is going to wake everyone up."

"You know her?"

"She was a good friend before madness overtook her," the Sorting Hat sighed.
"She was born when I was still a human, and I watched her grow up.
Did you know basilisk can keep a neutral gaze?"

"No...
You said something about madness?" Vlad asked intrigued.

"It's pretty new... eighty years or so.
She was in hibernation waiting for a new master before.
Salazar did not want her to stay alone."

"You knew Slytherin?"

"Of course, he was the one who transformed me, with the other founders' help."

Vlamdir noticed sadness in André's voice, but did not ask.
He hated being questionned on his feelings and appreciated the Muggle saying 'do not do onto others what you would not like to be done onto you'...

"It seems she is after you," André observed as the walls shook.

"Fawkes, can you bring me at the turn of the corridor where the Basilisk is, then move me like that until Sasssly is far from the common room?"

The phoenix did so, and Vlamdir jumped in space a few times to secure the dungeons, before getting back to his common room, then his bedroom.

Tired, he dropped on his desk chair and looked at Riddle's diary.
He could feel the link he had with it, two peices of a same soul resonating.
The feeling was different from the previous year, when he felt pain upon looking at Quirell.
Now the sould of the diary nearly brushed his thoughts, as to reel him in.
It was not surprising that Ginny Weasley was so sensitive to its influence if it had no mental barrier...

"You seem concerned Vladmir..."

The Russian jumped, having completely forgotten André was on his head.

"I was wondering...
You know Sasssly...
Do you know where the Chamber of Secrets is?"

"I do."

Vladmir took the Sorting Hat in his hand and stared at it seething.

"Could you say it earlier?"

"You never asked!" André protested.
"And I am blocked by some of Hogwarts rules!"

"His descendents are the only one able to find his laboratories," Vlamdir quoted, remembering the extract of the Legends of Hogwarts Kevin and Hermione had found in the Library.

"Exactly!
I can only help things along for the heir of Slytherin!"

"I am his heir by right of conquest."

"Seriously?"

"André..."

"Sassly's passageay leads to the girls' second floor bathrooms," the Sorting Hat sighed.
"But you will only be able to enter of you told me the truth."

"Second floor bathrooms...
Moaning Myrtle's?
Wait, some say someone died the first time it was open...
Her?"

"Indeed...
Myrtle Warren, a smart young Ravenclaw, but bullied by her classmates."

"You told of a passageway for Sasssly.
There is another way?"

"Yes, in the dungeons, Salazar's statue."

Vladmir immediately stood up, took the Horcrux with one hand, and André with the other.

"You're coming with me!"

"What about Malfoy Sr.?" the Sorting Hat protested as Vladmir ran out of the Ravenclaw common room.

"He can manage with Severus!"

"Blimey Vladmir, calm you Gryffindor instincts and think with your head and not your guts!
I know you want to avoid new attacks, but you can't rush headfirst into Sasssly!
She will just eat you whole!"

The young Russian stopped in the middle of the corridor and sighed.
He sipped into an alcove--no way he would let Filch catch him-- and took some time to think.
He leaved against the cold wall to go back to the temporary refuge of his mind and perfectly laid out library.

By finding the Chamber of Secrets, he would find the Basilisk's lair.
But André was right on one point.
Rushing into Sasssly's lair, alone and without preparation was suicidal, especially if the Basilisk was mad.
Dying would not help anything...
Mad?

"André, you told me Sasssly changed eighty years ago?"

"Yes, she would never have attacked anyone before."

"Wasn't that the time when Voldemort was studying in Hogwarts?"

"Indeed. What is your point?"

"Could it be that Voldemort bound the Basilisk using his status as Heir of Slytherin?"

"It's certain."

"As Heir, could I undo it?"

"Had you been his heir through blood, not while he was alive.
Since you are his heir by right of conquest, you are able to undo the links he created.
It is probable that a simple verbal order acts as a link and a word from you would coutner it."

VLadmir frowned while thinking about it, and suddenly had an epiphany.
If he could free Sasssly, he would have access to Basilisk venom!
And that was one of the most powerful venoms in the world, one of the only things able to destroy Horcruxes!
He could permanently get rid of the diary and free young Ginerva from Voldemort's influence!

"Thanks Andy!" Vladmir whispered, running back.
He barged into his room, finding himself facing Lucius and Severus.

"Mr. Kemenov, where were you?" the Potions Professor groaned.
"I was about to call you Head of House concerning your disappea..."

"No time!"

Vladmir threw him away and cast an _accio_ on his suitcase as Lucius stared at his friend being thrown to the ground.
The youngster was strong!
A small vial of scarlet liquid flew out of Vlad's luggage, and he swirled the potion before putting it in his pocket.

"Go back to your appartments and don't get out until I come back Severus!"

"Vlamdir, what is going on?"

"You are on a first name basis?
Charming", Lucius sniffed with a biting irony.

Vladmir stopped and looked dagger at the Lord with entirely black eyes.

"How is Draco?"

Lucius froze at the sudden change of subject and falsely calm tone of the young Russian.
He was not stupid and something bad was coming.
He stayed silent, observing Vladmir's harsh face.
This child did not look like a twelve-year-old...
Behind him, Severus wsa slowly standing up, worry visible in his eyes.

"'How is Draco?'
Is that what you expected from me?
That I would ask about your son's well-being?"

Lucius did not answer.
He could not, because of the magic that swirled around Vlamdir.
Powerful Dark Magic that made his stomach churn as it felt so close to his former master's."

"You have the Horcrux on youself," the Potions Professor immediately understood.
"Calm down, it intensifies your feelings.
You are more sensitive to it since you regularly use Dark Magic!"

A _Horcrux_?
Vladmir had Voldemort's diary in his pockets?
Lucius saw the Sorting Hat move on Vladmir's head...
'Time out', the Lord thought.
The Sorting Hat?
Merlin, what was the Sorting Hat doing his Katya's nephew's room?

Vladmir, at André's prompting, breathed deeply and his eyes turned back green.

"Thank you Sev..."

A groan answered him, making him laugh a bit.
'What was this child doing in Ravenclaw?' both Slytherins wondered simulteanously.

"Lucius, Fawkes will transport you back home.
Could you also bring Severus to his appartments?3 Vlamdir asked the phoenix sleeping at the foot of Kevin's bed.
The bird chirped positively and flew to Lucius's shoulder.

"Don't do something reckless, Vladmir," Lucius warned.

"You're valuing you hide, aren't you?" he smiled weakly.

"Katya would kill me if you had a problem after I came here."

"Love is harsh," Severus mocked him as Lucius disappeared.
"He is right, however.
At any sign of trouble, come see me or Filius...
I know you are powerful, and I trust you.
However, if I don't see you at half past six at breakfast, I contact your aunt."

Vlamdir nodded, relieved that Severus had not tried to convice him to accompany them, and he watched him disappear in turn.
Fawkes was quick.
Vladmir patiently waited his return, and put André on his bed, as he had started to softly snore once again.
When the phoenix came back, he petted his feathers and asked for another favour.

His new destination was a silent dormitory, apart from the snoring coming from one of the bed with drawn red curtains.
Vladmir smiled when he noticed that the only one whose curtains were not drawn was the one he was comming for.

He cast silencing spells before silently walking to Neville.
Unsurprisingly, he faced a wand that was very different from the one Neville used in class.

"Your father's wand?" Vladmir assumed.

"It doesn't have the Trace," Neville groaned while sitting up.
"Merlin Vlad, it's 2 in the morning!
What are you doing in the Gryffindor dormitory?"

"I know where the Chamber of Secrets is, and how to get rid of the Basilisk and the diary."

"Tonight?"

"The quicker we get to it, the lower the chances of a dead body."

"Any adults know?"

"Severus suspects something, but has no details."

"Why?
His experience could help us," Neville whispered, silently getting dressed.
"And it would be a good idea that someone knew what we'll do."

"We're going to break half the rules.
He will not lie by saying he did not know if we are caught."

"So he doesn't know?" Neville repeated, closing his cape.

"Not really.
He knows something is up and it has to do with the horcrux, but that's it."

"You are protecting him."

"That's the role of the Five Families," Vladmir smiled, taking his friend's arm.

"That whole thing is crazy," Neville groaned as they landed in another dormitory.
"The Five Families, Horcruxes, You-Know-Who, a Basilisk...
What's it going to be next time?
A psychopathic serial killer escaped from Azkaban?"

Both froze as they shivered like in a bad omen and looked at each other with skepticism.
What just happened?

"Which is Hermione's?" Vladmir eventually asked, observing the three hermetically sealed canopy beds.

"Good question.
Maybe the one with piles of books?"

The two boys looked at each other knowingly and walked towards the bed where several precarious piles of books were located.
Vlamdir took the time to cast privacy charms before motionning Neville to go.

"Right one!
Mione?
Mione, wake up," the Gryffindor whispered, rusting the curtains.

"Nev?
By all the enchanters, do you know what time it is?" a sleepy voice grouched as a hand pushed away part of a curtain to reveal an angry face.

"Two in the morning, I asked Vlad the same question a few minutes earlier.

Hermione slipped out of bed and pointed her wand to her roomates' canopied.
The boys noticed a silencing charm, far above the theoretical level of a second year...

"Already done," Vlad sneered.

"I await your explanation," the liones fumed, tapping her foot, her arms crossed.
"What are you doing in the girls' dormitory?
And I don't dare ask you how you climbed up here..."

"We're taking care of the Basilisk tonight and..."

"You need my licorine talents?"

Hermione had had time to accept her gift, with a week of more or less effective research in the Library, fortunately offset by her friends' and Potions Professor's knowledge.

"Even if you were not a licorine, we would have taken you with us," Neville smiled.

Hermione sighed in relied, smiling back.

"You'd better, otherwise you'd feel my wand.

She took a thick jumper that she put over the old t-shirt the she used as a nightgown and jeans.
She realised that the phoenix was here, readng the golden titles with curiosity.

"Fawkes?
I undestand how you came here..."

The fire bird cooed and flew to them.
Vladir took his friends' arms while Fawkes transported thme to their destination and they landed in a dark room.

"_Lumos_.
The Hospital Wing?"

"Of course Mione," Vladmir smiled.
"You did not think I would leave my best friend in this state?
Stay clear from the door, there are alarms."

Hermione, intrigued by the bells and threads around the door, froze and raised an eyebrow .

"You ordered the potion?"

"Yes."

"Weird that the parents did not protest after your aunt's annoucement," Neville declared as Vladmir approached Kevin, still petrified.
He had just taken a scarlet potion out of his pocket.

"Filch is an idiot, he worships Dumbledore, and if god says he can cure Mrs. Norris, then why question hum?" Hermione mumbled.
"That's a clever and sneaky system!"

Vladmir raised his head to look at Hermione.
He had put some of the potion on Kevin lips to give them their flexibility back, and he had to wait while it took effect.
Then he could make it run inside his friend's body.

"Finch-Fletchley is Muggle-Born, as is Colin Crivey.
Their parents don't know the potion is commercially available, and I doubt the Headmaster told them...
You know the wizarding society...
As long at they are Muggle-Born, it is secondary.
As for the ghosts...
They have always been second-class citizens, and since they are Hogwarts', they only matter in the school."

"Shameful," Hermione spat out.

Vlamdir put the potion in Kevin's finally freed mouth.
Hermione and Neville approached silently as they observed the results.
Slowly, Kevin's skin took back a lively aspect, then his body spasmed.
Before they could do anything, Kevin opened his eyes and rolled over to throw up the rest of of the potion, violently coughing.

"Shit," the young Ravenclaw groaned with a hoarse voice.
"I feel like I've been hit by a car!
What happened?"

"You were petrified by the Basilisk."

"I remember.
Bloody beast...
Hermione?
The ghost? how..."

"I'm fine, alghough the Bloody Baron was petrified, as you were."

"Seriously, saved byt the Slytherin ghost?" Kevin wondered, feeling his cloths for his wands.
He suddenly froze and looked at his friends, suspicious, as the phoenix was calmly perched on Hermione's shoulder and the sky was dark through the window.

"How long?"

"Not that long, a week or so."

"I thought the Mandrake draughts would not be ready until the end of the year?"

"Let's say that Vladmir declare that waiting was stupid, since you could buy the potion in in apothicary shop."

Kevin mumbled on the stupidity and incompetence of the Headmaster as he rose up.
He slowly stretched, his friends staring at him, and he grimaced as his back cracked.

"Are you feeling fine?" Hermione asked.

"Alright...
I think my muscles are little sore, but it's okay.
I feel ready to kick a Basilisk's butt...
Well, so to speak.
You seem... different."

"We'll talk about this later," the lionness smiled.
"For now, we have work to do.
Operation Basilisk can start!"

"You watched too many movies Mione," Kevin sneered at his friend's enthousiasm, as Vladmir gave him his wands back.
He put Lockhart's in his holster, and his in his pockets, while Neville looked at him weirdly.

"Moodies?"

"Movies," Kevin corrected.
"Unimportant Muggke things.
Who are we going to free from the Basilisk's fangs and a bad piece of soul?"

"Ginny, and all the Muggle-Borns in the school."

"Is she possessed?"

"She is.
We have the journal, the location of the Chamber of Secrets entryway, and the way to beat the Basilisk."

"How?"

Vladmir explained all to them.
He started from the previous weeks for Kevin, explaining the discoveries of Hermione's nature, then the discovery and exact nature of Tom Riddle's diary, the binding of the basilisk...
Kevin silently listened, his mind racing.

"You will force the Basilisk to obey you...
What if it doesn't work?"

"I will intervene," Hermione sighed.

"You are Muggle-Born.
Hos order, if I understand correctly, are to kill you, aren't they?"

"I am not a human anymore, well, according to Vlad..."

"So you probably are immune...
Was it targetting me?"

"Probably."

"Stupid question, but where is Draco?"

"He has other things on his mind," Vladmir explained.
"I had to get Lucius here to comfort him earlier.

"He had a hard time accepting the fact that his mother and father separated indeed," Kevin said, thoughtfull.

"That's a brilliant euphemism!
He is completely devastated..."

"So, are we going to the dungeons?"

The young Ravenclaw noticed his best friend's hesitant gaze, and smiled, announcing that if he thought he could wake him up from his slumber and leave him out, he was barking up the wrong tree.

"Alright," the Russian sighed.
"Fawkes, could you...?
Merlin, where has he gone?"

"I don't believe it, you left without me!" André protested, suddently appearing on Vladmir's head.

"You appearing on my head each time is annoying," the Russian sighed, making his friends laugh.

"I am happy to see you again Kevin!" the Sorting Hat exclaimed, not leaving Vlad's head.

A mocking quaver followed Andrés words.

"Admittedly, I am going to regret having the bed for myself," the Sorting Hat grumbled.

"You look like an old couple," Hermione smiled.

"You are still welcome," Kevin laughed.

"Is that a proposition, young man?" the antique hat joked, making the poor Ravenclaw blush.

It was in good humor that the core of the Alliance went to the Hogwarts dungeons, guided byt the two emblematic figures of the school.
THe phoenix dropped them off in a dead end, near a discret statue in an alcove.
The depicted man, great in stature, had a craggy face.
He seemed thin and nervous, although the artist had given his sculpture a certain softness.
The man had a snake and a book in hand, signs of knowledge.

"Salazar Slytherin," Vladmir softly noted.

"It doesn't seem very lively here," Neville said, noticing the think dust on the corridor's ground.

"We are in a disused part of the dungeons," André explained.
"Nobody comes this way any more."

"How do we open?" Vladmir whispered.

"You alone know it.
Only the heir can find Slytherin's laboratories and the Chamber of Secrets."

_"SSSalasssar Slytherin,"_ Kevin suddenly hissed.

The statue moved, a spark of life lighting in the stone eyes.

_"WHo are you, sssspeaker?"_

_"Name doessss not matter, Founder, only the line countsssss,"_ Vladmir declared.

_"Heir?"_

_"By right of conquessst,"_ Vladmir confirmed.

_"What about you?"_

Kevin clenched his teeth and proudly raised his head.

_"No wizard's blood rns in my veins.
I am Muggle-Born."_

_"Thisss cannot be, for both of you,"_ the Founder statue hissed back.
_"Only my line Sssspeaksss!"_

_"Then we are from your line,"_ Vladmir soothed.

_"No one entered here in ssssencutires.
Welcome, Heirssss!"_

The staue slowly pivoted, as if rusted by time, and Hermione looked at them.

"You know you spoke alone?
Parsletongue was the key?"

"Didn't you hear the statue speak back?" Kevin wondered.

"No, it stayed immebile," Neville slowly declared, curiously observing both Parsletongues.

"I think we shouldn't try to understand it," Vladmir sighed.
**"Burn"**

The torch in the entryway of the secret passage caught fire and Neville took it.
As a precaution, they all took their wand out before entering the dark passageway.
Past a narrow corridor, they happened on majestic stairs that slowly moved to bring them into Hogwarts' deeps.

The stairs stopped in front of a massive door, and Neville looked at the writings.

"Magica factum es veritas, sangis es magicum."

"Magic is in the blood?" Hermione wondered.

"Blood has many magical properties.
Although I am against discrimination many Pure-Bloods perpetuate, it is based on some truth.
Blood's truth."

Vladmir did not listen to Neville's explanation, and deeply cut his arm to throw his blood on the door.
It absorbed it, and the lion grumbled against the use of Dark Magic in the school.
The door slowly opened on the Chamber of Secrets.

"Incredible! It's..."

Kevin and Hermione rushed in the huge room.
Between the impressive library and the office, the place was indeed fascinating for the two Muggle-Borns, whose curiosity and thirst for knowledge were endless.

"It's... spotless!"

"As if Salazar left only a few hours ago," André whispered with melancholy.

Vladmir, the venerable artefact still on his head, noticed once more his sadness, and promissed himself to ask him what was his links with the Founder.
It was not the first time he referred to him by his first name.

"Vlad! Nev!
Come here, I found the labs!"

"I don't think the Basilisk is here," Neville delcared after looking in the famous labs of Slytherin.
As for the library, the room was perfectly cleaned.

"Do you think the Hogwards House Elves have something to do with it?" Vladmir asked, passing a finger on a one-way mirror.
Hermione and Kevin had already gone rummaging through the grimoires, careful not to trigger ay traps.

"Probably.
The families of House Elves serving in Hogwarts should trace back to the time of the Fouders."

"Elf!"

A slight pop rang out at Vladmir's summon, and a short House Elf wearing the Hogwarts livery bowed deeply to him.

"The Master called Silass?"

Silasss...
The servant in Parsletongue...
A fitting name...

"Are you the one taking care of the Cahamber of Secrets?"

"I am Young Master.
Silasss's family had this honour since the First Master."

"The Headmaster never asked you for this place?" Neville asked with curiosity.

"Never.
The Headmasters do not know.
The First Master specifically said that only the heirs and their guests can give orders to Silasss and his family."

"Each Fourder probably had his elves," Hermione hypothesised, approaching the small creature with curiosity.
Silasss looked at her with admiration and bowed to her.

"Lady Licorine is prodigious.
Lady Licorine is right.
Silasss serves the descendants of Slythrin as others serve the descendants of Lady Rowena, Lady Helga, and Sir Godric.
It is a miracle," the small elve continued a few seconds later, starting to cry.
"A Lady Licorine."

"Astounding," Kevin whispered, observing Silasss frozen before Hermione, who was scarlet from embarassement.
"Why have they not noticed before?"

"They never normally meet students.
It is only by seeing Hermione's aura that magical creatures understand.
Although Fawkes's case is intriguing...
He never reacted and I don't know why.
Silasss, I forbid you from telling your kind about Hermione," Vladmir said, observing the Elf.

The creature had a pained expression, but nodded.

"Where is the entry to the Basilisk's chamber?" Kevin eventually asked.

"The Young aster is standing in front of it."

Vladmir looked at the one-way mirror and put his hand on it, before opening his eyes wide.

"Goblin magic," he whispered, stunned.
"SLytherin created a Goblin transportation portal!"

"What do you mean?
I thought only Goblins could create them?"

"He probably had friends among them... Powerful friends.
Thank you Silasss."

The small elf bowed again and disappear with a pop, gazing once more at Hermione.

"It's horrible," the moaned.
"I hope they will not all be like this!"

"They probably will..." Neville graimaced, as Vladmir stared at the mirror.

"I think I know how it works..."

"So?"

_"Chamber of the Basssilisssk,"_ Vladmir enunciated, a hand on the cold glass.

He felt sucked in and smiled as he looked around.
Contrary to the laboratories, this place was cold, humid, and dark.
The atmosphere was heavy, giving the room a gloomy feeling, reinforced by the dozens of snake statues on the pillars.
He had found the Basilisk chamber.

Vladmiir went back to the empty wall, where only slight engravings revealed the presence of the portal.

_"Ssslytherin laboratories."_

Vladmir frowned when nothing happened.

"Not very reassuring...3

The young Russian jumped, having completely forgotten that André was still on his head.

"Don't scare me like that," the young Kemenov heir groaned.

"Try in English."

"Slytherin laboratories," Vladmir tried without really believing, before appearing in front of his two concerned friends.

"So?"

Vlad looked at Neville sceptically.

Neville and Hermione frowned themselves, while André whispered that the spent so much time with some Potions Professor that they took his facial expressions.

"Logical.
On our side, only a Parsletongue can go, but on the other side, to prevent the Basilisk from escaping, you need to speak English."

"I wondered if your place was not in Slytherin when I Sorted you," André smield, but you are undeniably a Ravenclaw Kevin."

"Have you seen the Basilisk?"

"Not a trace.
She should have a nest somewhere."

André changed heads and put himself in Neville's bushy hair before their crossed the mirror.
Once in the Basilisk chamber, which Neville supposed was under the Lake after he found phosphorescent algae typical of Scottish lochs, finding the nest was easier than expected.

For the simple reason that someone called the Basilisk.

"I thought you had the journal, that it was the thing possessing Ginerva, and that the Basilisk was roaming tonight?" Kevin whispered, poiting at the frail silhouette caressing the enoormous Basilik.

No one moved, knowing that any movement would catch the reptile's attention.
They were caught by surprise but managed to hide behind the pillars of the room;
Hermione and Neville, on the other side of the huge room, were silent.

"Indeed...
The diary must have grafted a part of the soul in her."

"Is it possible?"

_"I belive we have visitorsss pretty girl,"_ Ginny Weasley's abnormally hoarse voice.
_"You will eat earlier than planned."_

"Kevin, don't move and keep your eyes closed," Vladmir whispered before getting out from his hiding sport, trying his best not to stare into the huge snake's eyes.

_"Do not atttack me."_

The order, to Ginny's surprise, or rather the one who possessed her, was obeyed and the Basilisk hissed as she rolled up into a ball.
Her hesitation was palpable, even for the three invisble spectators who worried to death for their friend.

_"Ho are you?"_

_"My name doessss not matter, only the line countsss..."_

Some sentences were important in the Pure-Blood society.
This was one of them.
The person themselves was not relevant.
The name and ancestry were essential.
It was the case for Slytherin, and the Five Families.

_"I am the only heir!"_

_"You are Tom Marvolo Riddle.
You are Lord Voldemort."_

_"How..."_

_"Sasssly, as heir of Sssalazar Ssslytherin, your First Massster, by right of conquessst, I order you to ssstop your attacksss on the cassslte!"_

_"NO!
Kill him!
Kill this usurpser!_"

Vladmir felt the bind in Voldemort's voice, but the Basilisk was a magical creature.
As all creatures, she instinctively felt the magical links.
And the being inside Ginny's body was not her master any more.

Furius, Voldemort took his wand out to hex the Russian.
He was quick, but Vladmir overcome him without a problem.
Enven thought the Dark Mage was hugely powerful and knowledgeable in his normal state, the body he possessed was not.
He could not prevail against the young Russian who was trained since early childhood.

Once Voldemort was solidly tied up and his wand confiscated, Vlamdir took the diary out of his pocket to examine it.
The possessed girl's hazel eyes followed the Russian's fingers dance on the dark cover warily.

_"Sasssly, close your eyes and do not attack the othersss.
They are my friendsss."_

_"Yesss Massster."_

I have a question, Riddle," Vlad lowly declared, as Neville, Hermione, and Kevin stepped out of the shadows, wand still in hand, looking out for any danger.

"What is it?" the Dark mage responded, intrigued by this boy who knew his name.
Something told him not to cross this child who, despite his young age, oozed Dark Magic.

"How many Hocruxes did you create?"

"How do you know this is a Horcrux?"

"I belong to a Dark family," Vladmir calmly answered.
"However, I am surprised you managed to possess someone this easily."

"She opened her heart to me, gave me all her pains, her ridiculous crushes," Voldemort sneered.
"It was so easy to transfer my sould into her once she lowered her meager barriers."

"Let me ask again.
How many Horcruxes did you create?"

A heavy silence fell, before a strange sound rang out in the room.
Vladmir held back a smile when he saw Kevin pet the Basilisk's nose and whisper her reassuring words from the corner of his eyes.
He was the only one that would ignore one of the greatest Dark mages of this time.
Apparently, the reptile was in awe of Hermione, probably because of her blood, although the young girl was not really up to petting the scales.
Neville stayed focused on the problem and stared at Voldemort's eyes with hatred in his eyes.

Vladmir did not stop looking at his enemy either, but the latter stayed silet until...

"Who are you?
Nobody defeated me, and the Basilisk should not have recognised you as my heir by right of conquest.3

"This Basilisk has a name.
She is called Sasssly.
Ti answer your question, the piece of soul I am speaking to did not know my victory indeed.
I don't know when you were created, but I defeated you in 1991.
I am called Vladmir Kemenov."

"Vassili has better not oppose me.
The Kemenovs are once of the oldest Dark families of Russia!
On the contrary, you have many things to gain by joining me.
You power and my knowledge, together, we will do great things!"

"We call that megalomania," Hermione sighed, making Neville smile.

"So you know my clan...
However, my birth name is not Kemenov.
I was born Harry Potter, and I suppose Ginerva told you about my exploits?" Vladmir sneered as Voldemort spewed his hatred and his contempt in response.

"Vlad, time is ticking," Kevin declared, observing Voldemort tied up on the ground, furious that he was defeated--again-- by _Harry Potter_.

"Okay.
_Sasssly, could you please bite in thisss?_"

_"No way Young Massster,"_ the Basilisk hissed in disgust, looking at the diary Vladmir held at arms length.
Hermione, who was fed up with Voldermort's screams and useless attemps for freedom, cast an _Immobilus_ on him, making him silent.

_"Please."_

The Basilisk froze, then attentively observed Vladmir with its green non-lethal eyes.

_"You are the firssst to be cordial with me sssince the Firssst Massster, Young Massster."_

She sprang onto Vladmir's arm, clutching her maw on the Horcrux.

The scream that pierced the silence of the Basilisk chamber was horrible, coming both from the journal and young Ginny.
Liters of ink spewed on the dirty tiles, and Ginny's body slumped down.

_"Revolting!
I hate dead meat and herbsss,"_ the Basilisk hissed, looking at the tattered diary.

"You should get her back to her dormitories before she wakes up," André declared while Neville quickly covered Ginny.
"I don't think she will remember anything."

"Fawkes, could you do it please?"

The phoenix cheeped, infuriated, and took away not only Ginny, but also Hermione and Neville, André still on his head.

"Why did he take all Gryffindors in one go?"

"I think he is fed up with shuttling back and forth for tonight," Vladmir grimaced, finally petting the Basilisk.

_"Sasssly, don't attack humans any more."_

_"Can I leave the cassstle again?_"

_"Where did you go before?"_ Kevin wondered.

_"In the Forbidden Foressst._"

_"In thisss cassse yesss, if you ssstay out of view,"_ Vladmir smiled.

_"Will you come sssee me?"_

_"Of courssse!"_ Kevin's voice rose up.

_"Not usssing those labs would be shameful.
We know someone who will love to use them,"_ the Russian, imagining Severus's face in advance when he will discover Slytherin's Chamber of Secrets.

_"Thank you, Young Massster."_

<hr>

One hour later, Kevin was back in the Hospital Wing to get back to sleep and surprise the Matron, while Vladmir, in his room, was petting Fawkes, who was sleeping on his stomach.

"So, André, I have a few questions for you..."

"Go on Vlad," the Sorting Hat answered with a sleepy voice.

"Has Dumbledore never noticed your absence?
Especially Fawkes?"

"Bubus never was Fawkes's master.
It was Gellert Grindelwald.
As for me, I usually gather dust during the year, cast away in a closet."

It was not hard to notice the bitterness in the words of the venerable artefact.
In the time of the Founders, André had taught the arts of the spirit to his students, and he had continued for centuries, even when Transfigured into the Sorting Hat.
He appreciated his new life, until the Ministry considered this type of magic as dangerous and regulated it.

"I am a magical artefact.
I am unfit to teach."

"Binns is a ghost!" Vlad took offence, angry at the causes of the Sorting Hat's pain.

"I know.
As if the Ministry ever was know for being a model of equity..."

A heavy silence fell, then Vladmir thought about a detail.

"Fawkes was linked to Grindelwald?"

"Indeed.
Wizards and witches tend to forget that they were friends."

"Intimate friends, from what I was told."

"I see you have good informers."

"You could say that you need to know your friends well, and your enemies even better.
Dumbledore became the latter the day Katya discovered he had named himself my guardiand and had abandonned me to the Dursleys.
Although it doesn't expalin why Dumbledore stays around Dumbledore."

"He promised Gellert, before he died in prinson.
SInce then, he awaits his new master.
Had you got have a second question."

"I have.
You know Hogwarts so well and you were human...
Who were you?"

"I have not told my name in... centuries.
No one knew me enough to know I was human...
I was called Andrade Slytherin, but my brother always called me André."
