# Chapter 39: Forgiveness and the Unforgivable

Sirius Black suffered.
He was suffering in every cell of his body, and his sould was also screaming in pain.

Admittedly, he had serious injuries, some of them infected, but the worse part was the psychic pain.
Sirius was seeing again and again this face so close to James's, with eyes as green as Lily's...
But is was not amusement or love that he could see in it, but pure ratred, making them as murderous as the _Avada Kedavra_. It ws a cold mask that froze such familiar features, freezing his heart.

His mind raced through the scene in a loop: this hand that rose up, wand in it, then this foreign word, oozing Dark Magic.
And the pain that exploded...
Those physical lacerations, and the mental ones, that reached hil.

Slowly, Sirius came back to reality.
He realised that his body was less painful.
His migrane did not make him want to hit his head on the ground to stop the suffering.
His torso did not burn in pain any more.
His muscles, weak and atrophied by years of imprisonment and mistreatment, were not as sore.
As for the cold...
This cold that gnawed at his sould and heart, rekindling his worse memories, that cold that tortured his body...
The cold had disappeared.

How much time had he been unconscious for?
Espectially since he almost felt good, which was deeply surprising.

Sirius then was awared that he was wrapped up in something soft.
Eyes still closed, he realised that the softness and the heat were due to the thick duvet on him, and the soft pillow under his head...
Merlin had granted him his oldest wish...
He had given him rest...
He was finally dead.

"Awake, Black?"

Maybe not, Sirius thought.
This sarcastic voice, so familiar, and yet so far back!
He slowly opened his eyes, turning his head towards the person who had just spoken.
He immediately saw two deep black balls, highlighting a thin and pale face that he knew well.

"Sni..."

Sirius hesitated for a few seconds, and held back his tongue.
He had grown up, and despite everything, he remembered the promise he made to himself in prison.
He had suffered the guards' bullying too much to allow himself to continue his childish attitude towards Severus Snape...

"Snape?" he slowly conitnued, still uncertain.
Maybe it was his perturbed mind that imagined the presence of his punchbag beside him.
It would not be the first time he hallucinated, and certainly not the last.

"Prince, now," Severus corrected him, carefully closing the book on his lap, before putting it down on the small pedestal table beside him.

The man seemed to have kept watch over him, judging from his crumpled deep blue robes and his tired eyes.
He was calmly sitting down in a seat next to his bed, his hair boudn in a thick ponytail...

Sirius paused in his analysis of his former punchbag.
Blue Robes?
Thick ponytail?
Where had the greasy Snivellus, who always wore a black outfit, gone?
Sirius grimaced when he saw the Potions book, but swallowed back his mean words.
Definitely, he was not in a parallel dimension.
Maybe one of his delirium, that he regularly had, where memoried miwed with nightmares...
Snape regularly was a part of them...
Time out.
Not Snape any more, but Prince?
Like in 'Prince, Nott, Potter, Bones, and Rowle'?

"Yes, those Princes."

Sirius grimaced when he realized he had talked out loud.
He should be careful now that he had left Azkaban.
All the prisoners had taken the habit to talk to themselves to hear something other than the wind and the screams of the insane, to keep some part of humanity...
He started to shake when the horrendous memories of the damp and dirty cells cames back.
The vermin in the straw matresses, the constant humidity...
The Dementors...

"Harry..." he suddenly moaned, searching for his godson with his eyes, both worried and impatient.
"I remember hearing him when the Dementors...
He must have suffered and..."

"Calm down Black," Severus cut him dryly.
"Now, he's called Vlamdir Vassilievitch Kemenov," he added more softly, avoiding to shock the man.

Sirius now seemed to panick at the thought that his godson could have suffered because of him.
Black's memory was failing him if he thought that Vlamdir could not defend himself.

Kemenov?
Slowly, things connected back in Sirius's mind.
The joy during their second year, as well as sadness...
His best friend had discovered he had a sister, while he had always dreamt to have a younger brother.
But she was a baster half-sister, born from his father's affair, one which had started more than 10 years before...
James then started to become aware that his parents were not as happy together as he had believed.
Worse, he had been shocked to learn that Charlus Potter had his wife's blessing, and that Dorea Black-Potter was warmly welcoming the young Katya and his father's true partner, Anna Kemenov.
Because both women had been true friends...

Sirius remember that he had laughed when his friend, traumatised, had told him amout his half-sister's arrival one evening, and the joy that his mother had shown when seeing her husband's mistress...
James had discovered, that day, that what he was living was not so rare with arranged marriages.
The couple gave birth to an heir, then led their life on their own, only keeping appearances for the rest of the world.
However, children born from those affairs were rarely as accepted by the spouse as was Katya by Dorea.

"Black?"

Sirius noted the slight touch of worry, although Sna... Prince kept a perfect mask.
Why did he seem so worried?

"Kemenov, as in Katya, James's sister?" the fugitive eventually asked.

"Exactly.
She was the one who raised him, not the Dursleys."

"Thank all the mages!" Sirius suddenly vehemently spat out.
"This little Petunia bitch and her whale of a husband so..."

He had to stop mid-sentence when he felt pain in his torso spike.

"You little stupid Gryffindor, lie back down!" Severus yelled, pushing him back down softly on the mattress, mumbling against stupid dirty mutts.

The injured stayed silent while Snape took the bandage off of his torso.
Sirius could thus notces the huge scars that marked him now, a fine scar tissue highlighting the marks.
The pain came from his side, where one had opened again slightly.
He could ony stay silent, staring at the blood dripping.

Piching his lips, Severus wiped down the wound, and covered it with an ointment with a suprising colour.
As red as blood, with a fascinating golden shine.

"A Gryffinsor potion?" Sirius painfully smiled.

The Potions Master gave him a glacial glance.

"A Potion made from unicorn blood."

Sirius grew paler as Severus continued taking care of him, satisfied with his half-truth.
He silenced his ward, while not really lying about the origin of the blood.
When Sirius learns the truths, he'd have to thank Hermione for the blood donation that saved his life...

After Severus solidly reattached the bandages, Sirius accepted the potion he was given, not knowing it also contained some of Hermione's blood, and had been administered to him for three days... since that disastrous Hogsmeade weekend.

Severus washed his hands, looking at his convalescent's pale chest, marked by starvation and injuries due to a certain thirteen-year-old wanting revenge.
Vlamdir did not do things by halves when he put his mind into it.
His curst was so vicious that usual healing methods were inoperative, and the Dark Magic in the wounds was particularly virulent…

Without Hermione and her extraordinary blood, Sirius never would have survived, unless they had a phoenix on hand.
Although Vlad also had one.
This kid was fully of surprises…

"Where are we?" Sirius eventually asked, ripping the Potions Master away from his thoughts.

"In a safe place," Severus mysteriously answere.

He wondered how the former Marauder would react when he'd realize who his hosts were.
But for now, he was too perturbed for him to add to it.
Severus wondered if he should also give him a Dreamless-sleep potion…

The clearest proof of Black's state of mind was his repeated zonin out.
Black already had three since he woke up.
To see the man's grey eyes cloud over, staring at empty space as he took refuge in his thoughts, was quite anxiety inducing.
And adding to that were his emotional fluctuations.
Severus had seen him smile, then cry, then be angry, all in the span of ten minutes.

He would ask Katya to have a specialist come see Lord Black.
Prison had highly damaged his mind, and he was not the best one to help him for that.

"What happened."

Severus carefully looked at him, then sat back down in the comfortable chair that he had slept in.

"What do you remembered?" he asked, crossing his fingers under his chin, not looking away from Sirius.

"I wanted… to enter the Common Room, but the Fat Lady refused.
She started to yell, so I fled and…
cold… so cold… the Dementors…"

Severus raised an eyebrow when the fugitive spontaneously transformed into a dog.
He must have spent a long time under his Animagus form for it to be his first reaction when he felt angry or insecure.
But he had resisted until then…

The Potions Master observed the trembling shaped of the impressive Irish Wolfhound hiding under the blankets.
A light tick made his brow shake, only sign of his irritation.
He should have guessed, the animal was the spitting image of Black.
Extremely loyal like all dogs, looking both noble and scruffy at the same time.
He had a rictus when he remembered that the Irish Wolfhoud was his ancester's hunting companion.
Too bad he could not inform the man without it raising embarassing questions.

"You don't have to fear anything here, Black," Severus eventually said, standing up.
"You are free to get out of your romm, but I recommend against fleeing.
The Master of this place configured the defences to keep you in.
Some things need to be cleared up before you can go.
I also believe that Katya contacted Amelia Bones to give you a Veritaserum trial...
But for now, you are still a fugitive.

As the Potions Master was about to close the door, he looked at the bed, exchanging a glance with the deep grey and imporing eyes of the dog who was not so dog-like.
Maybe something else needed to be said…

"And Katya is not as patient as I am, Black.
You won't be able to hide behind your Animagus form."

Satisfied, Severus disappeared in a cape swirl to go back to Hogwarts.
He had lessons to give, and more importantly, a band of teenagers to escort to Malfoy manor.
The previous day, Halloween went peacefully, for one, and Vladmir had invited his friends in Russia for the Day of the Dead, with the Professors' blessings…

To say that the Headmasters had forgotten that rule centuries ago…
Students could leave the school for wizarding holidays, but strangely, no student could attend since…
Since Dumbledore became Headmaster, actually.

Severus grimaced at the memory of the man he had considered a mentor and a friend for all those years.

"So?" Vladmir's voice asked sudenly, bringing him back to earth.
The Potions Professor suddenly realised he had appeared in the Chamber of Secrets' library and, puzzled, looked for the boy.
He finally raised his head, and found him riding Sasssly's back, Sasha in a deep conversation with the Basilisk.
He noted that the small Ice Viper was less present those days.

"Severus?"

"He is finally awake, but quite confused," Severus sighed, getting back to reality.

He looked at the empty room, wondering where the other members were.
It was rare to see Vlad without Kevin or Neville…

"Kevin told me about a conversation with Theo about explosions, Neville is pampering his new acquisition in the school greenhouses, Luna went to join Ronald's sister, Hermione is helping Cedric with homework due tomorrow, the twins are negociating with Flint the share of profits for his House's contraband marker, Draco is playing the Slytherin Prince behind Parkinson's back, André is debating with Augusta about the importance of restarting Occlumency training, and Filius is preparing his next lectures," Vlamdir calmly enumerated.

Severus smiled slightly.
Katya had taught him well.
He was ready to bet that most of the Alliance members had not told the Russian about their occupations.
But he knew.

"I would like to make the most of this alone time together to talk about something that bothers me some," the young Russian suddenly declared.

The Potions Master nodded and sat down in a chair, while Vlad slipped down from Sasssly's neck to sit down on the floor, his small viper nestling in his lap.

"Where had Sasha been all that time?" Severus could not help but ask.

Vladmir gave him a wonderful smile and hissed a few words in Parsletongue at the small viper.
A few minutes later, Severus had dozen baby snakes on his lap, coming from seeminlgy nowhere.

"She was brooding?" the wizard nearly choked.

He liked snakes, after all he was not Head of Slytherin for nothing, but it was another thing to be covered in so many babies from one of the most lethal species of magical snake!

"Yes," Vlamdir said, extatic, petting Sasha's rigs.
"She wanted to surprise me!
As viviparous, she hid with Sasssly to avoid me noticing the size of her womb."

"Huh…
What was your question?" the man asked, carefully getting the snakes off his lap, softly pushing them towards their mother.
In a few seconds, Vlad was covered in sleepy snakes, which did not seem to bother him.
Severus briefly wondered about the legend of Medusa.
The Greek Mythology Gorgon maybe was a Parsletongue witch…
The small snakes netsled into the Russian's hair, brining silver into the black strands.

"Was Sirius Black part of the _Underground_?"

Severus shivered slightly.
The involontary Parsletongue intonations in Vladmir's words forced him to remember bad memories from his time beside Voldemort.
He pushed back the flashbacks, using his Occlumency training, before answering.

"No.
He disagreed with his family and Pure-Blood traditions.
Blacks being Mirages from generation to generation, he turned his back on the Court.
In his head, the _Underground_ and his family were 'Evil', while the Potters, Albus Dumbeldore, and the Order of the Phoenix were 'Good'," Severus sniggered.
"When you look at their leader, you might wonder if he chose the wrong camp…"

"He should know for Bubus.
It was him who sent him to Azkaban without a trial," Vlad said pensively;

"I don't know, he's very perturbed."

"Did you leave him alone with Katya and Lucius?"

"I did.
Worried?" Severus jeered.

"Not really, Katya is direct and Lucius…
He's always polite, but his truths are all the more hard to hear.
I think it will force him to gt back to reality," Vlad declared softly.

Severus was not so sure, but did not try to contradict him.
The future proved him right.

<hr>

The next day, the core of the Alliance went to Augusta's office first thing in the morning.
They were leaving with Severus and the Headmistress to Malfoy Manor, their sole stopover before getting to Kemenov Palace to celebrate the Day of the Dead.

"Ah, you're finally here," Katya sighed.

With a rare elegance in a deep red warm robe, the Russian witch seemed weary.
The reason for her state became evident quite soon.
Yells could be heard in the upper floors.

"Sirius and Lucius," the young woman sighed.
"I think it's not prudent to leave them alone together, even for a few hours."

"Black tends to infuriate the people surrounding him," Severus  mocked, as everyone turned their heads uo.

Katya grimaced when silence fell back down a few minutes laters, and she stretched wearily.
She had hope to officially present Lucius Malfoy to her clan on this day of celebration, but she needed to wait a bit.
He refused to let Black in his home without being present as well, and, from her point of view, leaving them alone together was out of the question.
But she swore that the two British wizards would pay for this bad start of the day.

As soon as Lucius had learned that his cousin was awake, he had inisted on seeing him.
Three words…
It all went awry after three words…
Since the previous evening, there was a full-on war between the two men.
Insults and double-entendre flew.
Only her presence prevented them from brawling with each other.
Judging only from ear, Katya would never have guessed that one of them was recovering, nor that they were adults.
And the worse was that they voluntarily provoked each other, like two competing kids.

"Vlamdir, go see them," I think Sirius must be exhausted from all those… emotions," Katya enventually declared, slightly sarcastic.

The Russian boy looked at her pensively, before whispering something in her ear and softly kissing her cheek, then went up the stairs.
He only had to follow the voices…

Augusta and Severus exchanged glances, then advised the children to sit down.
They would not actually leave immediately.
Katya called for one of the Malfoy House Elfs to get them hot drinks, before going to a small shelf.
She opened it and smiled at Lucius's reserve.

"Augusta, Severus?"

"If you please," the Potions Master accepted, taking a glass of Firewhisky, while Augusta refused, staying with her cup of tea.
It was only nine in the morning, it was quite early to drink alcohol.
But she had to concede that looking at her Russian friend's face, she needed a tonic.

While everyone impatiently waited to go to Russia for various reasons, Vlamdir was guided by the vehement discussion between the British Lords.

"… fucking Death Eater!" a hoarse voice screamed.

"Shut up you mutt!
You are a guest and…"

Vlamdir pushed the door open, and looked at Lucius, who immediately fell silent.
He could not see Sirius Black, hidden by the sofa, but apparently his mere presence sufficed to calm them.
The last time he saw this much ange on Lucius's face was when he repudiated Narcissa…
Thinking about her, there needed to be a discussion about the ex-Malfoy, and Vlamdir absolutely did not want to be present if they already yelled at each other for no reason.

"Lucius, can I talk to Black alone?"

"Please do, Vlamdir," the Lord mumbled, walking past him.

Vladmir sighed and walked around the sofa.
He immediately noticed the presence of the superb Irish Wolfhound sprawled in front of the fireplace, who looked at him with warily.
Vlad had only seen his godfather's Animagus form when he had injured him and found it… apeasing…
As if he had seen it already in his early childhood…

To see the barely noticeable flinch the beast had when he approached upset him, even if he understood perfectly…
The only time they met was not a happy time.

He slowly approached and sat down on the rug, near the dog, while leaving him some space to avoid scary him.
To his surprise, Sirius immediately put his head on the Russian's lap, who softly smiled while pet the dog's ear.
Sirius's fur was soft and glistening, meaning he was perking up again.
However, Vlad felt the ribs under the thick fur.

"I sincerely apologise, Lord Black," he said slowly.

The dog raised his nose towards him, and Vlad looked into two pained grey eyes.
A few seconds later, he had his hand in black wavy hair, although veined with a few grey strands.

"You don't have to apologise, Vladmir Vassilievitch," the man declared with a hoarse voice, embracing the Russian.
"And for the love of Merlin, no Lord Black!
For you it's Sirius, or Padfoot…"

Vladmir, although surprised the man had realised that his name was not Harry any more, did not hesitate and hugged him back, being mindful of the injuries he knew were hidden under his shirt.

"I am the one who has to apologize…" Sirius continued.
"Please forgive me Lil' Prongs…
If I had not asked for Peter to be the Secret Keeper, your parents and you would never…"

"You could not have known, Sirius.
There is nothing to forgive."

Vladmir stood up and slowly reached out his hand to help his godfather stand up.
Sirius took his hand, and Vlad pinched his lips when he noticed how thin Sirius's hand was.
Vlad helped him lie down on the sofa and kneeled down in front of him.

"You are in a poor condition, and I'm partly at fault for that…"

Sirius smiled a bit.

"My health was already horrible when I escaped Azkaban.
And two months running from the authorities did not help me heal."

"But…"

"I am not angry with you, Lil' Prongs," the wizard whispered, passing a shaking hand in Vladmir's mid-length hair.
"You have your father's hair.
It was a good idea to have it longer to straighten it."

"I injured you, and I wanted to kill you."

"You thought I was your family's murdered.
But I swear that I would never have betrayed you, James, or Lily."

Vlamdir smiled slightly as he felt the man's weak magic seal his oath, then frowned as he saw Sirius's suddenly paler face.

"You are not in any shape to do magic," he rebuffed him slightly, looking daggers at his godfather's face.
He only got a small laugh in response.

"You look like you mother this way.
You…"

Someone knocked and Sirius fell silent when Lucius entered, followed by Severus.
Vladmir sighed when he saw the gaze the two Lords exchanged, while the Potions Master had a mocking smile.

"Anything wrong Lucius?" Vlad asked with another sighed.

"Nothing Vlamdir, but every one is waiting for you.
The connection to the international network will lapse in around fifteen minutes."

Vlamdir nodded.

"Where are you going?" Sirius asked in a whisper, looking at his godson painfully.
Vlamdir's heart ached from seeing the pleading eyes.
Blimey…
He felt like he was abandonning him!

"In Russia, it's the Day of the Dead, and this year we're going to see Katya's mother's tomb…"

Sirius's gaze became haunted.

"Did…
Did you ever go to…"

"To Gordic's Hollow?
Every year since I was one," Vladmir smiled.
"Severus, is Augusta staying with both of you?"

"Indeed.
She said there should better be some arbiter in the room, as I would be too partial."

Vlamdir softly laughed, whispering that it was obvious.
He walked to the door and looked at the three men.
Sirius had sat up, and apparently, even if he had fought against traditions for all his life, they were deeply fixed in him, judging from his proud and aristocratic posture as he stared at the Malfoy patriarch with contempt.

"Don't mess about boys," he sniggered.
"Lucius, one small piece of advice.
Be really careful, you never really saw Katya angry, and she is not far from boiling over…"

He did not know how right he was when Lord Malfoy grimaced slightly before nodded, with Severus glancing at him mockingly.
As Vladmir left, he still heard Lucius' response, and especially the bark-like laughter that accompanied it.

"I'll wait to see when you find your other half!"

He joined Hermione, Neville, Draco, and Kevin, in a gave of Exploding Snap that ended when Neville's pile jumped with a loud noise, masking his swear.

"No death?" Hermione asked, amused.

"Well, I found Sirius in a pool of blood, Severus dancing with glee around it, while Lucius tried a voodoo spell to ensure the ghost would not haunt Malfoy Manor forever.

"So every thing's good," Neville translated.

"Ready for the Russian winter cold?" Katya asked, smiling.

"Well, I think Sergei prepared something to warm us up," Neville moaned, remembering his first and last experience with Icevodka.

Katya laughed out loud, suddenly more relaxed, and passed a pot of purple Floo Powder.

"Why purple?" Draco wondered.

"Not very legal," Kevin laughed.
"It's international, but not approved by the authorities, otherwise it would be red."

"How do *you* know that?" Hermione asked, astonished.
Kevin simply winked at her and took a handful.

"Kemenov Palace!"

The chimneys connected to the international network flew past him, and after a few seconds he saw the lighter light of his destination.
He prepared his landing and jumped out of the fire in front of a familiar vampire.

"Sergei."

**"Kevin…
You're the first.
How are you?"** the vampire asked, not paying attention to the use of his native language.

**"Well, much better now that my roomate is smiling again,"** Kevin laughed, stepping to the side as Draco stepped out of the hearth in turn, dusting non-existant soot from his vest.

**"When have you learned how to speak Russian?"** the vampire suddenly realized, smiling as he caught Hermione whose feet caught in the chimney steps, avoiding a painful fall.

**"It's crazy what magic can help us do!"**

The vampire laughed out loud and affectionnately ruffled the ravenclaw's auburn hair with one hand, stabilizing the young licorine with the other.
With two occupied hands, Sergei could do nothing but see Vlamdir fall on the ground, covered in soot.

"I had forgotten your clumsiness, Kitty," Katya laughed as she stepped out herself while the young Russian grumbled while he stood up, making the small friend group laugh.

Katya observed the five children with their faces so full of life, their bond so tight that it could be frightening…
She suddenly noticed Hermione's slight shiver as she discreetly approached the fire.

"It is indeed a little cold in the Palace during winter…" she admitted.
"Don't move…"

With a flick of her wand, Hermione's clothes transformed into a thick woolen cloak lined with white fur, while Kevin and Draco's coats took a stiffer aspect, with a scaly shine.

"Why leather for us, and not on Hermione's cloak?" the young Slytherin asked with curiosity, savouring the sudden warmth.

"In Russia, the women's everyday cloaks are made with Mooers wool, while the men are made with Dragon leather," Vlamdir explained.
"The only exception are for formal dresses, in which case the men wear woolen cloaks."

Draco nodded, as they followed Sergei and Katya through the palace.
It was not the first time the Alliance members were invited, but the place was huge and confusing.
According to Vladmir's explanation, this corridor maze was one of the many defence mechanisms of the Kemenov residence.
It was thus extremely easy to get lost…

They eventually got the the large entry hall and the majestuous stairs of hounour, then walked outside of the Kemenov palace.
They biting cold attacked them immediately.

"I had forgotten how cold it was," Kevin mumbled, wrapping himself in his cloak.
The palace nearly seemed hot, in comparision.

"And it's not really winter yet," Sergei laughed, wearing a simple shirt, one of the advantages of being a vampire.

"Alright, let's go to the cemetary…
Stayd right next to us until the magical quarter.
I put up a Muggle-Repelling Charm, but it has a small radius," Katya said.

A few snowflakes fell, making the setting cozy yet elegant, as the small troup of wizards and witches made its way to the Palace Square.
The wizarding cemetary in Saint-Petersberg was below the huge core of the magical quarter, on the banks of the Neva.

There were many Muggle passers-by in the famous avenues near the Winter Palace, and Draco could look at their cars.
He wrinkled his nose at the smell in the air, but stayed silent as they approached the entry to the secret world of Magic.
They would be able to ask Professor Tonks an excellent question, and he even wondered if he would have the time to take a photograph for his homework on Muggle means of transportation.

Then he realized that the wizards and witches wore party clothes with bright colours.
They faces were relaxed and friendly.
Temporary salesmen offered candles with varied shapes and colours, fruits and vegetables, wooden statues, jerky, flowers…

Only Neville, who had taken part in the ceremony, vaguely knew what to expect.
Although not to this point…

"Why all this?" Kevin asked, gesturing to the vendors and customers.

"To make offerings on the tombs," Katya explained.
"We're nearly there, you'll understand quickly!"

The entry to Saint-Petersberg's cemeraty was marked with two chapels with round, golden domes.
Runes and cyrillic letters were ingraved on there, and two statues guarded the entry.
Magia and Gaia, the two protectors of witches and wizards, kept watch over the Dead.

Passing between the two chapels, Neville and Kevin looked at each other before looking at the ground.
Under their feet, fine lines of runes ran next to the doors and followed the walls.

"Protection runes.
No one can enter this domain if they have bad intentions, and the people buried here are protected from all appropriation attempts."

"Appropriation attempts?" Hermione repeated, surprised.
"It doesn't exist in Britain!"

"Indeed," Draco aquiesced.
"But it prevents corpse stealing wiht Dark Magic or soul recall.
There are very few cemeteries guarded by Magia and Gaia in Britain."

"Only two: Gordic's Hollow's and the Trafalgar Square catacombs," Sergei added.

"There are catacombs under Trafalgar Square?" Kevin winced.

"It's London's wizarding cemetary.
Ours is different."

Indeed, the wizarding cemetary in Saint-petersburg had nothing to do with tunnels…
It ran along the Neva over several kilometres, thousands of tombs raised towards the swowy sky.
A huge alignement of vaults, along the retaining wall, seemed to watch over the whole thing.

What surprised the English children the most was how lively it was, and they nearly had to be pushed by the three Russians to go on.
Whole families parties over the tombs, thousands of candles burned over the white stone crosses, while the few birches which managed to grow between the gravestones were covered in brightly coloured ribbons, each a message to Mother Magia.

"Merlin," Draco whispered, the first to find his voice again as they crossed the cemetary, walking between the vaults belonging to the illustrious Russian Pure-Blood families.
"It's…"

"Russian traditions," Katya continued with a soft smile.
"Come, we're nearly there!"

She guided them towards a small mausoleum covered in gold.
Strangely, the onlookers and partying people became silent and respectful before walking in front of the gate.
Some even took the time to worshipfully brush the names engraved in cyrillic on the stones.

"Is it a memorial?" Hermione asked in a whisper.

"It's not…
It's the Kemenov family tomb," Sergei explained quitely.
"The vault of the wizarding branch of the Russian imperial family."

The young girl blushed and Draco pinched his lips and Neville had an apologetic face.
It was so easy to forget that their best friend was the legitimate heir to the Russian Throne.
So easy to forget that he might be the Crown prince of the English Throne as well, thanks to his affiliation to the Five Families.

Kevin was the only one to not react, and he bowed slightly towards the shadow at the entrance of the vault.

**"Your Majesty."**

**"You learned Russian, young Kevin?"** Nikolai wondered with a smile, leaving the shadows.

**"I needed to, Vlamdir keeps mumbling in that language!"**

The former Emperor and autocrat of all Russia Nikolai Alexandrovich Romanov laughed out loud and greeted the newcomers, before turning back towards the blue-eyed Ravenclaw.

"I am surprised that you noticed me in the shadows, child.
Although I should not be, judging form what I hear from my Heir and my Sire."

Kevin smiled warmly as he turned towards the two of them.
Vlamdir shook his head, while Sergei simply laughed.
Nikolai gestured them to come closer, inviting them in the Kemenov mausoleum.

Draco was the first one in, giddy at the idea to discover more of a culture praised for its traditonalism in the magical world.
The polar mages were the ones who kept the most traditions, refusing to mix with Muggle cultrure.
From what he knew, Russians did not celebrate Christmas, Hallowe'en, or Valentine's Day.
They had kept the magical traditions.

Neville followed, slightly worried.
While the Longbottom heir was honoured to be invited, he was apprehensive about the future celebrations.
Even two years later, he remembered how Ice Vodka burned.

While Hermione walked past Nikolai, curiosity in her chocolate eyes, the latter delicately touched her hair, as if hypnotized.

**"Lady Licorine…"**

Hermione blushed at the unexpected gesture, and instinctively moved towards Sergei.
Contrary to Neville and Kevin, she had never really met the former Emperor of Russia.
She had only seen him the previous year as he accompanied the Dark Mage Rasputin, who had come to save Vladmir from his curse…

The vampire was not scary, but his gesture made her uneasy.
Nikolai stepped back to appease the girl, aware of her discomfort, as Sergei laughed.

"Nikolai does not bite, Hermione.
My vassal simply showed you the respect your blood deserves."

"By touching my hair?" she mumbled, unconsciously touching her slightly crazy hair.

Sergei sniggered, and softly straightened her hair.

"He still is a young vampire," he said, "he's attracted to you like bees are to nectar."

"I did not want to scare you, my Lady," Nikolai sighed.
"Please receive my apologies…"

Kevin, who had silently observed the scene, walked towards Hermione and gallantly offered his arm.
The young girl put her hand on his sleeve, reassured by the familiar presence of the Ravenclaw, and let herself be guided inside.
Sergei, Katya and Vlamdir looked daggers at the former Emperor, who looked back sheepishly, before entering after the children.

"Are you ready to get pissed, kids?" Sergei asked loudly, distracting the children from their astonished contemplation of the place.
The Kemenov vault was enormous, very far from the splendid but small mausoleum on the outside.
A gigantic gallery housed dozens of alcoves on each side.
Each housed a statue and an urn.
The ashes from the wizard or witch, and their protrait.

At the vampire's words, Neville grew paler and Draco raised an eyebrow in surprise to mask his worry.
Sergei lauged out loud.
Apparently, the young Longbottom had shared his experience with his friends.

"Don't listen to his banter," Vladmir sighed.

"Sergei is mocking you," Katya added.
"Makes you wonder if he really is an old vampire born nearly a thousand years ago and a famous clan chief…"

"Venerable, dear, I am a venerable vampire born a thousand years ago!"

Katya childishly stuck her tongue out at him, before guiding them to an altar in the middle of the majestic room.
A simple, empty, stone bowl was on it, and she put a golden candle, decorated with delicate arabesques, beside the bowl, and put a few flowers bought on the way on the candle.

"Please accept this offering, Mother Magia, in the name of the Kemenov line."

The wick ignited with a crackling of raw magic, and Hermione held back a surprised sound.
Katya smiled as she set down another candle, this time a deep silver engraved with elemental symbols, which she completed with a small pice of bread and a fruit.

"Please accept this offering, Mother Gaia, in the name of the Kemenov line."

Once more, magic manifested itself and the second candle burned up.
Katya took out a knife and scratched her hand to let a few drops of her blood in the altar bow, followed by Vlamdir and Nikolai.

"Please accept this offering, ancesters of the Kemenov line, in the name of your descendents."

A whistle could be heard as the blood of the three members of the Kemenov family boiled.
In a few seconds, it had fully disappeared, leaving the bowl as white and empty as when they had arrived.

"Why were your words different?" Neville asked, remembering the ceremony on James and Lily Potter's tomb.

"Because it was a single couple's tomb.
We are in a mausoleum.
The corpses and ashes from around fifty Kemenovs lie here, so the ritual phrases are not the same.
We honour the line, and not a single person.
Only the patriarch, or the matriarch in my case, can lead the ceremony."

"And now, let's honour our Dead," Sergei said loudly, getting an enormous bottle of Vodka from under his cloak.

"Sergei!"

And after Katya hexed the vmapire, Draco, Hermione, and Kevin finally discovered the wonderful Slavic traditions for the Day of the Dead.
Hermione was horrified to see the amount of alcohol the four Russians could gulp down, especially her friend…
Draco, however, had made the mistake of trying to follow suit, getting a sarcastic look from Neville.
He was fortunately saved by Nikolai, who forced him to drink a potion against drunkedness right before they ate.

Near the evening, as they had participated in the procession of the Dead, as well as the huge common meal on the Palace Square, Vladmir went to a small alcove alone.

"What is he doing?" Neville asked, pointing to his friend.

"He is honouring Natashka…"

Vlamdir kneeled down in front of the urn and the statue representing a young blonde girl.
His friends recognised her face, as she had appeared during the duel against the Russian mercenary the previous year.

A soft song rose up from Vladmir's lips, and Katya softly joined him, followed by Sergei and Nikolai.
Kevin, the only one who understood Russian among Vladmir's friends, closed his eyes as he listened to the lyrics.
They were about love ans resignation, the joy to know that the essence left a harsh world to become Magia, while the body went back to Gaia.

It was the last thing they did in the mausoleum.
They went back to the Kemenov Palace, tired from the cold and the day's hustle and bustle of the day.
Indeed, honouring the day while enjoying life to the full was… exhausting.

Augusta had agreed to let them rest the next morning despite the classes, using the school's ancient rules.
Katya had thus prepared rooms for every one…
Unfortunately for Kevin, Vlamdir wanted to do something else.
The Russian had waken him up in the middle of the night…

"Where are we going, Vlad?" Kevin mumbled, still sleepy, following his friend aling the Neva.
He was cold, and the snow was slowly but surely falling, covering the ground with a thin layer of powder snow.

"To a meeting!"

"That time of night?"

"Speak Russian," his friend groaned.

**"Vladmir,"** the young Ravenclaw was infuriated, **"I value my life, so tell me a good reason to sneak out from under your aunt's watch?"**

**"We're going to Moscow."**

**"To…?
Vladmir Vassilievitch, if you don't explain immediately why we must sneak out to go to Moscow in the middle of the night, I swear I will wake up the whole palace!"**

Vlamdir froze for a few seconds on the quay, before smiling at his friend's glacial gaze.
Kevin's blue eyes were as cold as the ice covering the river.

**"It has something to do with the Five families.
I have a lead to follow for the prophecy and…"**

**"That's what you do discreetly when I'm sleeping?"**

**"How do you know?"**

**"Vlad…
We've shared the same room for three year.
Three years I've put up with you and your little secrets,"** Kevin said mockingly.
**"I know when you're trying to hide something!"**

**"… you are worse than Katya and Sergei combined!"** Vlad sighed.

And to say that he admired his extraordinary observation skills…
Kevin sniggered and distractedly tapped his foot, impatient.

**"So?"**

**"I have to see a friend at the _Sermirrov_ headquarters.
Katya doesn't know I'm doing research, and I trust you to cover my back."**

**"You know I am not a member of the Mirage Court?"**

**"I know…"**

**"Isn't there a rule like…
Any non-member will be killed?"**

Vlamdir rolled his eyes and sighed.

**"No.
You are with the Heir to the Triads.
Frankly, no one will bother you.
Plus, I have a cloak for you."**

Saying this, the Russian took a dark thing from his pocket, that he unfolded.
Kevin frowned when he noted the coat's red edging.

**"Why is yours grey?"**

**"Observant,"** Vlamdir said, amused.
**"Red for the Mercenaries.**

**"So, grey for the Politics…
And the Smugglers?"**

**"Gold.**"

**"Makes sense,** Kevin mumbled, putting on the cloak.
**"They only like hard cash!"**

He put his hood over his head, and Vladmir tapped his back with his wand.

**"I'm hiding the Court's symbol,** Vlad explained.
**"It will reappear when we are in the headquarters.**"

**"What symbol do I have?**"

**"English."**

Kevin sighed and had to follow his friend to an inn on Palae Square, wondering what kind of mess Vlad had put him in again.
Then he imitated him when he used the Floo network to get to another inn in Moscow.

**"Now, you stay behind me,"** Vlad whispered as he pushed him towards a hidden door.

**"Identify!"** a voice coming from the void demanded, as they were stuck in a small antechamber.

**"Green Bolt and Bronze Snake, from the _Underground_,"** Vladmir declared, letting a magic wave out so that the room could identify him.

**"Welcome, Heir.
Greetings, Colleague."**

To Kevin's surprise, the door opened.

**"Told you so,"** Vladmir declared smugly.

Kevin simply sighed and followed his friend, thinking about the nicknames given by Vlad…
It was logical, when you thought about it…
Mirages did not know each other, so code names were necessary.
But he had never payed attention to it before…

The corridors of the Russian Court's headquarters were empty at this time.
Too late in the night, but too early for the morning…
Vlad had perfectly chosen his time, and he led his friend towards a dimly lit office without seeing any other being.

**"May your gold prosper, Warrior Jorgl."**

**"May wealth settle, Friend of the Nation.
And may it help your friend as well,"** the small hooded person added in gold-edged robes.

Kevin smiled softly and entered the room.
So small, and with such wording, even a simple mind would have deduced they were meeting a Goblin.
He observed the room closed behind them, and noted the suddenly active magical field.
As if the Goblin waited for this sudden protection, he took his mask off, showing the typical Goblin smiled with razor sharp teeth.

Kevin followed his friend's lead and pulled bach his hood.
He let the Goblin silently observe him, and held back a sigh as the two members of the Russian Court started to talk in Gobbledegook.
He calmly leaned against the wall, near the door, and started to flippantly play with his wand, looking at each detail in the office.
His attentive gaze alerted the Goblin.

$ Is he trustworthy? $

$ He would not second me if he was not, $ Vladmir declared coldly.
He was wearing the polar mage cold mask.

$ He is just a child. $

$ Who am I? $

$ A prince.
A Tsar.
An Heir…
A Friend of the Nation. $

$ So you know my judgment is right, $ Vladmir said, using his status.

_"Vladmir.
If you made me come here to listen to Gobbledegook all night, I will make your life hell in Hogwarts,"_ Kevin suddenly hissed, making the Goblin jump.

**"A Parsletongue?"**

Kevin was sure that if the small warrior could have grown pale, he would have.
A warm, soft smile streched his lips, but his eyes told something else, throwing daggers at the Goblin.

_"Calm down, Kevin, he trusts me, therefore he trusts you…"_ Vladmir sighed.
**"Warrio Jorgl, let me introduce you to my brother in arms, Bronze Snake.
Brother, this is Jorgl Dignir Beldor."**

Kevin Noticed the accentuation Vladmir put in the _brother in arms_ words, and he swore to ask more information later.
It seemed to be important in the presentation.

**"A powerful name for such a young child, but o so revealing,"** the Goblin whispered.

**"Yours is as powerful, Master Goblin,"** Kevin politely answered, standing up to face the creature.
He noted the grin his friend made, and the satisfied spark in Jorgl's eyes, and he knew he had just scored a point.

**"So you know my clan…"**

**"Even in wizarding circles, Beldor means riches.
The Siberian Gold Mines are very important in the economy of the magical world."**

Kevin thanks Augusta to have hired a competent History of Magic professor in Bagshot.
It was not Binns and his eternal wars who could have help him undersant the real reason for the Third Goblin War.
He also thanked Professor Selwyn for having taught him the basics of the magical economy and the monetary system.

**"Jorgl is one of the best Suppliers in the _Sermirrov_,"** Vlamdir quickly explained, **"and I requested a favour of him as a Friend of the Nation."**

**"Were you not a Friend, Prince Potter, I would have helped you.
The Five Families are essential to renew Magic, and the issues you raised are… horrible.
I thank all the Ancients that you have this much intuition."**

The Goblin offered him a stack of parchments that Vladmir started to read.
Kevin watched him carefully and immediately noted signes of anger, even if his face did not move.
The Russian's emeral eyes could be very expressive, if you knew where to look, even if he wore a mask.

**"Thank you Jorgl.
I would like to have another piece of information."**

**"His location?"**

**"Indeed."**

**"He vanished…
But his rare accounts are frozen, and we are actively looking for him."**

Vladmir thanked him and quickly left the _Sermirrov_ headquarters, his anger barely not boiling over.
He eventually exploded on the Neva quays, as they walked along the river to get back to Kemenov Palace.

**"The son of a bitch,"** he spat out.
**"This bastard dare to do that!"**

Kevin stayed silent and cast a discreet hiding charm around them.
A few Muggles passed by despite the time, and they had better not be the centre of the attention.

**"Who?"**

**"Dumbledore!
If he ever reappears, I will kill him!
That twat!
That wretched upstart!"**

**"What did he do?"**

**"He betrayed Magia!"** Vlamdir yelled.
**"He attecked the Five Families!
I swear on my magic that he will pay!
That fucking…"**

Kevin, still calm, wondered if his spell would hold against his friend's anger, and if the things around them would stay whole.
He could already see fine cracks travelling on the concrete railing.

**"Calm down, Vladmir Vassilievitch,"** Kevin declared distinctly.
**"Now is not the time to break the Statute of Secrecy."**

Vlamdir looked at him with a terrifying glance, and Kevin shivered.
He never saw this glow in his friend's eyes, not this coldness under his aristocratic traits.
It was beyond hate.
Judging from his eyes, he was not a thirteen-year-old child any more, but a full-blown killer.

Kevin knew what Dumbledore had done for power and money.
And he was afraid of what he would discover: what could be worse?
He also knew that whatever Vlamdir did, he would support him…

**"You'll have your revenge, Vladmir, and I swear that I will follow you wherever you go, whatever you do.
But please calm down, by Circe!"**

As soon as Kevin uttered those words, he felt a hard knock on his heart.
Under the pain and the surprise, he fell to his knees in front of his friend.
He clutched at his robes on his heart, struggling to breathe.

**"What have you done, Kev?"** Vlamdir groaned.

Kevin held back a scream when the pain stabbed him.
Looking between his tears of pain, he saw his friend put a knee on the ground and softly kiss his forehead.

**"I accept you oath, Knight-Mage Kevin Warren Entwhistle-Potter, may Magic be my witness,"** Vlamdir whispered.
Immediately, the pain subsided and Kevin could finally look up.
**"Idiot."**

**"What…
What just happened?"** Kevin moaned.

**"You fully qualified to swear an oath of vassalage,"** vladmir whispered, his forehead still on his friend's.
**"The fealty…
The honesty of your declaration…
The friendship…
And the words…"**

**"I… I…"** Kevin stuttered.

**"I am a descendent of the Knight-mages, and a Prince of the Court of the King of England, Kevin, even if it is not official…
I can raise men to knighthood if they swear an oath of vassalage to me."**

Kevin raised his head, pale, and looked into his friend's green eyes.
Anger had gone, know replaced by disbelief and worry.

**"I'm your vassal?"**

**"Magic is our witness.
I owe you protection, and in exchange, you must respond to my call when I need your strength in battle."**

**"Like during the Middle Ages…"**

**"Yeah…
Wizards are a few centuries late on this point,"** Vlamdir chuckled as he stood up.
He reached offered his hand to his friend, who accepted the help.

**"How did you call me?"**

**"Knight-mage Entwhistle-Potter.
You are the vassal of the Ancient Potter Family, my name brings you protection…"**

**"Why are those things only happening to me?"** Kevin sighed, looking at the arm that burned him.
**"Er Vlad…
Is that normal?"**

Kevin pushed his sleever up, uncovering his forearm.
The Potter coat-of-arms was clearly visible in black on his pale skin, as was, more importantly, the symbol of the English royal family.

**"Yeah…
Sorry, that's the symbol of your… servitude."**

Kevin smilled at his friend's embarassement, then thought that the Death Eaters were similarly marked.
He would bet that Voldemort wanted to consider them as vassals…

**"Vlad, don't be sorry!
You said that only honnest and sincere friends could swear that oath.
I consider this an honour."**

**"Oh, it is and honour!
However, you'll have to explain a few things, kids…
You sneaking out at three in the morning, the capes, the wave of Dark Magic that all the detectors in the palace alerted us about, and especially how Kevin managed to swear and Oath of Vassalage!"**

The two Ravenclaws looked at each other.
Katya Annopovna Kemenov was absolutely not in a good mood.

<hr>

After getting a memorable earbashing for disappearing in the night, Katya also vehemently yelled at her nephew for hiding things from her.
She did not appreciate that he persisted in his silence, only telling her to prepare a Five Families meeting.

Her screaming at the biys intrigued Sergei, who looked into the Kemenov matriarch's private officed.

**"Are you up to you mischief again, Kitty?
Oh, you're getting interesting, Kevin!"** the vampire added, seeing the mark on the Ravenclaw's arm.

**"Don't encourage them!"** Katya yelled.

Sergei frowned, but bowed to the outraged Kemenov matriarch.
Eventually, the two children were brought in front of another angry person, although the reason was different.
Logicially, Katya had not hidden Kevin's new status from the main beneficairy, and Severus had not appreciated the news, especially when woken up in the middle of the night;

"What do you mean a vassal?
Morgan knows I do not want a Court!" Severus yelled out in Katya's office.
"A vassal!
And you named him nothing less than a Knight-Mage!
How did this happen, anyway?"

"I need you to sit down for this," Vlad sighed, as Kevin stayed calmly stayed in a corner.

The Potions Master hestitated, but eventually sat down, as Katya settled down behind her desk.

"Explain!" Severus growled, making both Kemenovs and Kevin shiver at the magic infusing his order.

"The king has spoken," Kevin vaguely whispered for himself.
The wizard heard him, however, and paled when he realized the importance of his words on the two Russians and the young Ravenclaw.

"Di you remember the Five familied meeting?" Vlamdir asked softly, breaking the silence.

Severus and Katya slowly nodded.
How could they forget?
It was the first time in a century that all the lines had met.

"Somehting bothered me.
A comment from Damocles about Dumbledore, saying that he was also responsible for our woes."

Severus stayed silent, wondering where he wanted to go with this, while Katya clenched her first.
She felt that the man would cause problems again…

Vlad dreamily pet Sasha, who had just appeared around his wrist, then he looked into the Potions Master's eyes.
The latter paled as he saw the expressionless deep green eyes on a face as cold as Siberia.

"I investigated around.
We know perfectly well that he hid your line from you.
But I also discovered that his name came up again after Damocles's twins' accident, but also for Susan's parents'."

"Go on."

"Don't you find it strange that suddenly, after the magical world nearly forgot our families, we all suffer waves of 'tragedies', to use the prophecy's words?"

"Not really, there was war, the dead are many…" Severus answered vaguely.

However, Katya was more wary.
Vlamdir would not go to that hypothetical without a good reason, or even proff, which he must have gone to the Mirage Court to fetch it this night.

Vladmir slowly told them his ideas.
Apart from Severus's case, whose mother was dead before he learned the truth about the Five Familes, which Dumbledore took great care to never mention when he was his guardian, the Rowles also suffered an important loss.
Vivian and Melusine Rowle were the couple's first-borns.
They were born in 1983, and had perished two years later with their aunt in a Floo accident.
Gwenelle Rowle had falled ill, and her husband had watched her, entrusting their two daughters to their aunt, so they could go to their grandmother's.

"Damocles and Gwen should have died that day.
They had bought the powder the day before at an apothicary on Diagon Alley."

"If you're talking about the apothicary, there must be agood reason," Katya slowly declared, thinking carefully about all the details her nephew gave them.

"Precisely…
The shop belong to some Percy Felton.
Who happens to be Dumbledore's nephew…"

Then he talked about the others.
Susan's parents belonged to the Order of the Phoenix.
Form that they could understand from letter exchanges with Amelia Bones, they had recieved a message from the Order to signal a Death Eater attack.
Except only both of their corpses were found without any trace of a back up.
From the evidence, they were two against a full Death Eater team.
And strangely, who was the leader of the Order and had the power to send them there?

"And my parents, Katya…
Albus Dumbledore did not advise them against an untrustworthy Secret Keeper!
I think that's too many coincidences."

"I don't see what Dumbledore would win if he suppressed our families' internal knowledge…"

"I do'nt know Severus, but he is implicated in four of our families.
It is as if he wanted the descendants under his tutelage!
Amelia nearly died a week after her brother and his wife.
Susan would have been fully orphaned, as we both were!"

"What about Theo?" Katya asked, lost in thought.
All was coherent, except the Notts were not cited.

"His mother died in an explosion," Kevin suddenly declared slowly.

The two wizards and the witch turned to him, having completely forgotten his prenseced.
He gave them a mocking smile, and walked to sit down on Valdmir's seat's armrest.

"What did you find?"

"I was intrigued by Theo's fear…
The explision was linked to a Potions accident, which killed his mother.
According to him, she was mixing a fertility potion for her husband, to have another child.
Nott Senior was a little late, and Theo was curious and was glad to have a litle brother.
He watched his mother do the potion, and everything blew up when his mother added an ingredient.
Guess who was the supplier?"

"Felton," Vlamdir spat out, turning to Katya.
"Still thinking it's a coincidence?"

The two adults slowly shook their head.
Vlamdir was right, it was too much to just be bad luck.
But why did they never realize it?

"I still don't understand Dumbledore's goal…"

"It's obvious," Kevin declared, frowning.
It made all three curious.

"It is obvious that he was looking for power.
Hogwarts Headmaster.
Chief Warlock of the Wizengamot.
Supreme Mugwump of the International Confederation of Wizards, and everything…
It was so much political power in one man, and he only missed the Minister for Magic title.
The only risk for his rise to power was a real leader to Magical England appearing.
By breaking the File Families and his descendents and their bonds, he would make the real Wizard King disappear."

Kevin fell silent and observed them silently.
Katya was boiling in anger again, while Severus and Vladmir stayed strangely calm…

"Where is he now?" the Kemenov Matriarch asked, seething.

"He disappeared".
