# Chapter 42: The Return of the Monarchy?

Theodore Nott Sr. did not consider himself as a good wizard…
Nor as a lovable or amicable member of society.
Every one around him would say that.
Well…
Some people already had knowledge of his ability to love and simply be human: his late wife, his son, and now the rare remaining members of the Five Families.

Apart from those rare people, Lord Nott was cold, distant, and inflexible, a most dangerous politition among the Conservatives.
He had long been considered as one of the extremists when he joined politics, but the current magical world did not please him.
Keeping their ancestral traditions, absolutely; keeping their archaic way of life, no.
Few knew he was working on the creation of a new party.

By standing there, besides the Head of the Department of Magical Law Enforcement, with all the wizarding aristocracy looking at him, Theodore Nott Sr. wondered what would become of him, and if his ideal would see the light of day.

He knew that many people would gossip because of his and Severus's presence.
They had followed the Dark Lord's ideology, who promoted the safekeeping of wizarding values which slowly disappeared.
And while Lord Voldemort's goals had changed, Lord Nott knew something.
No one turned their back to the Dark Lord.
He had thus continued to serve him against his will, although not seeking to betray him, sontrary to Severus.
He remembered what happened to the young Regulus Black for daring to think about betraying him.

Theodore Nott did not have a choice any more.
While the Dark Lord would have forgiven his entry in a movement more tame than the Conservatives, he was now officially a traitor to Voldemort's eyes for his new friends.
Amelia Bones, Harry Potter, and Mudbloods only were obstacles and trash who, if he had followed his former lord's line, he would have had to get rid of as quickly as possible.

On the other hand, Lord Nott did not choose any alliance.
He returned to his origins.
To the origins of his family…
To the origins of Magic and the magical world.

He was a Prince of the Magical Kingdom of Great Britain.
He was one of the most influential beings in that kingdom, in influence, prestige, and magical ability.
Lord Voldemort's Heir of a Founder was nothing compared to Lord Nott's genealogy.
Furthermore, contrary to most other Pure-Bloods, whose inbreeding had reduced the power, the Notts had always carefully chosen their spouses.
There had to be no direct relation between the two spouses.
And to do this, his family had turned to foreign nobility.
His late wife was from a rich and prestigious Swedish family, and she had given her pale skin and blue eyes to his heir.

And while Voldemort had taken the time to learn the wizarding traditions as he should have as a pretendant to the Heir of Slytherin title, he would not be able to blame him for his change of alliegeance.
After all, by affirming themselves like this, the Five Families lured the wizarding world with the return of the Monarchy.
The return of the magical traditions, and of Ancient Magic.

Theodore Nott was a former Death Eater, he knew that he would have to constantly justify his every move, but he would follow the line set out by the Five Families.

He would follow the Five Families' line, whatever the cost, because it was what was best for the wizards and witches.

<hr> 

Amelia Bones was falsely nonchalantly leaning on Theodore Nott Sr.'s arm.
Even if she had understood the reason for his alliegeance to the Dark Mage after long conversations with the Lord, he still was a Death Eater.
While she accepted his traditionnalist ideology‑all members of the Five Families fundamentally were traditionnalists, even if not always affiliated to the Conservatives‑she could not condone the barbarous acts all Death Eaters had done.
But on the other hand, what were they, compared to the prestige of the Five Families.

They were a powerful symbol for the wizarding world.
A sign of imminent change, of rallying, but not to camps like the Light, or the Dark.
No, the Five Families were a symbol of a rally under the banner of the Wizard-King of Britain.

Amelia gave a truly warm smile to her partner.
Death Eater, Auror, Lawyer, Mirage… all their differences in their professions' legality disappeared when they gathered around Severus Prince.
They were not enemies, but allies, advisors to their Kings…
Even if the latter did not want to hear about his throne.

It was one of the missions she had given herself.
To convince the brooding Potions Master to accept his place in the magical world.
Too much corruption and decadence had invaded the leaders of the wizardin world.

Lady Bones had front-row seats to see the true political manoeuvres, the true rulers.
And Cornelius Fudge was only a puppet in the hands of the other Pure-Bloods.
First under Dumbledore's thumb, although the Minister denied any and all influence from the old wizards, then under Lucius Malfoy's, then, surprisingly, Amos Diggory's.

All the laws that had passed despite all her atteprs.
All those laws that gave so many advantages to politicians.
All those laws that gave so many privileges to Pure-Bloods.
All those laws that gave so much power to wizards.
All those laws that took so much from the Creatures.

Amelia had had enough: she did not want to see the world sink down into corruption without being able to do anything against it.
The British magical world needd a true leader, a constitution to base laws on, apeople to rule, equal in rights, whatever their ranks.
British wizards and witches had forgotten the true place of Magical Creatures and the true nature of Magic…
They needed the return of a king on the throne.

The king had to return on the throne, whatever the cost, because it was what was best for the wizards and witches.

<hr>

Damocles Rowle regretted that his children were not at his side, but they were far too wyoung.
Then again, his youngest was so young, he could not have been there.
He sighed and ignored his wife looking daggers at him.

For his deepest despair, Lord Rowle had to use the Ancient Marital laws to silence his wife.
He loved Gwenelle more than anything in the world, but his duty had to go before his love.
And his duty was to the Five Families.
He had to serve his king.

Gwen could not accept the presence of a Mirage, nor the presence of former Death Eaters among the descendants of Arthur's Knight-Mages, arguing about their "Dark" approach of magic.

To Damocles's despair, his wife actually had a very narrow view of Magic, perverted by centuries of fallacious teachings, the accomplishment of which was Albus Dumbledore's appointment as Hogwarts Headmaster.
Light, Dark, Blood, Rune…
Nothing in that was important, only the intentions were.
And the British had forgotten that a long time ago.

She was going to stand up against him and the Five Families…
And to protect Artus's Heur, Lord Rowle had to silence here thanks to the magical links of their marriage.
The tradition was fixed in the old Pure-Blood families to subscribe to an Ancient Wizarding Union, given the husband all right on his wife.
Gwen had never been constrained by her husband, like most witches under this kind of union.
The magical links were almost never used, but she had understood what she objected to.

Damocles hated Dumbledore with all his sould.
He was responsible for the lack of knowledge in the current in furture generations, but above all, responsible for the fate of his twins.
The man had harmed the Five Families to pursue his debasement of Mother Magia and satisfy his thirst for power.

The return of a king on the British throne would finally allow them to establish the truth on Magic.
Damocles prayed for the return of the monarchy.

It had to hapen, whatever the cost, because it was best for the wizards and witches.

<hr>

Katya was not a true Potter.
James, her brother, had recognised her, but she was still born out of wedlock.
According to the Ancient Laws, this illegitimate birthed made the Potter name intransmissible by her blood, contrary to the young Susan who would transmit the Bones name to her children if they were born under a Wizarding Union.
Vlamdir, contrary to herself, born an heir, could take his responsibilities when he turned 16.

For now, he had the Lord status, but could not sit in the Wizengamot because of his age.
Damocles would do it for them.
A good comprimise, because the man was officially neutral.
Lady Kemenov had made this choice very carefully.
To give the vote to a person other than the Head of one of the Five Families would give them a considerable political power…
Although Augusta Longbottom could have taken care of the Potter seat…
Lucius was too known as Dark for that.

The Russian woman smiled discreetly as the attention was turning to them.
The Five Familied appeared united for the first time in decades, and many were suspecting change would come soon enough.

Katya Annapovna Kemenov did not have anything against democracy…
If what not a sham, like it had been in Britain for a long time…
The laws, the government…
Everything was led by a racist and Pure-Blood minority.
The Conservative Party had been in power for decades, when political alternation was key for maintaining democracy.
The true Democrats, the ones who demanded equality of rights, had nearly disappeared, preferring to hide under a neutral mast.
As for the Liberators…
The defenders of interracial equality had long since disappeared from the political scene.

Katya only wanted to offer her nephew the best.
And that meant a sane country with a strong Magic.
And both necessitated a total change from the present.
She agreed with Lady Bones: to establish order and equality in the British wizarding world, she would support the renewal of the monarchy.

Katya would support the renewal of the monarchy, because it was the best for wizards and witches.

<hr>

Severus Prince was carefully watching the reactions on the faces of the Pure-Bloods.
The Saturnalia ball was an essential event for the new year celebrations for wizards and witches and each year, the noble families were playing a power game to chose which one would have the honour to organize the ball, and especially preside over the magical ceremony that closed it.
An Ancient Magic ceremony, one of the rare ones still practived in the British wizarding world.

This year, Augusta had managed to win this influence fight…
However, the fact that the venerable Longbottom matriarch had come back from her long retirement from the High Society had helped her case.
Mean rumours had circulated, arguing that she had finally grieved her vegetable son to focus on her bumbling grandson, but she had ignored this vile talk to focus on organising the ball, leading the Mirage Court, and managing Hogwarts.

Which shows that the Longbototm façade was well oiled, Severus though, holding back a sigh.
It was difficult to see the usual virulent, stubborn and excentric Augusta Longbottom in the hostess.

The heir to Artus Pendragon, king of magical Britain, let his gaze go through the ranks pressing around the stairs.

Once more, he could see hope light up the faces around him.
What worried him the most was seeing the determination in the eyes of the other Heads of the Five Families.
Damocles Rowle, Theodore Nott, Katya Kemenov-Potter and Amelia Bones had a proud and defiant look in their eyes.

Severus still did not precisely inderstood what the wizards and witches expecetd from the return of the monarchy, but the more time passed, the more scared he was.

> When the heir and the spy mingle once more,
>
> When the past and the future in one blood will fuse,
>
> When Darkness on our world will spread,
>
> Tragedy will strike the descendants and around the Prince they will gather.
>
> Gawain and Galahad will be dual, the patriarchs watching over them.
>
> Tristan and Percival will be opposed, good against evil, darkness against light.
>
> Tragedy will strike the descendants, and around the Prince they will gaher.
>
> Around the Prince the descendants will gather, and Magic will rise up again.

The prophecy was turning in his mind, whispering incessantly that he was a Lord now, and especially a Prince, and that he had duties towards others…

However, he did not want that burdent.
And that was why he cursed Dumbledore for hiding his ancestry from him.
To hide the role of the Five Families, and especially his heritage…

Severus Prince felt like he had missed some essential thing about the importance of the monarchy.
Some thing that all others had understood through their knowledge of the magical world;
Despite himself, he looked at Kevin, who was wearing extremely rare robes, because they were not worn since the time of the Knights of the Round Table.
The Knight-Mage robes…
They were a deep purple, which inspired the Auror robes, they were caracteristically sleeveless, showing the impressive tattoo that was a symbol of their duty.
The young Ravenclaw was wearing his outfit nobly.

Severus was sure that Kevin and Hermione, whom he saw further on Draco's arm, knew more things than him about the traditionnalist wizarding world…
He definitely ought to ask Marcus Selwyn…

In the meantime, Lucius, Augusta, and the children were walking towards them…
Severus held back a desperate moan, preparing to suffer a true political masquerade planned by his dear and priceless Princes of the Five Families, with Lucius's and Augusta's complicit help…

Neverus had always hated social events, he was awkward in crowds.
But the hope he could see in many of the guests' eyes was very disturbing.
For the wizarding people, Severus would accept to do some effort and accept his rank.

He would accept his rank, whatever the cost, because he unconsciously felt that it would be the best for the wizards and witches.

<hr>

Vladmir had no reason to like the British wizards and witches.
They were self-important, retrgrade, racist…
They did not have much to be liked.
And yet…
After Katya had forced him to go to Hogwarts, he had understood that not all were this way.
One only needed to look at Kevin, Hermione, or even Neville!

Draco had been a more delicate case.
He was at first one of those hung-up Pure-Bloods that Vlamdir hated, bragging about piddling titles, not understanding true nobility.

Contrary to him, Vlamdir was the Heir of one of the highest 'Dark' lines of Russia, and its associated clan, as well as Heir of a high 'Light' lines of Britain, Tsesaravitch of Russia through Katya's maternal line, Prince of England through his paternal line, not to count his rank in the _Semirrov_, the Russian Mirage Court.
He knew how absurd this accumulation of titles was…
Ad yet, he did not brag…
And he strongly doubted that the British wizards and witches knew the imperial nature of his blood.

He did not like the British wizards and witches, quite the contrary.
Vlamdir hated most of them.
Starting from the corrupt politicians in the Ministry.
He hated them with all his heart.
He hated those men and women who did not properly protect the magical world, who failed to defend peace and unity, who wallowed in immoral laws designed for their own advantage, and not for everyone's equality.
He hated the society which had congratulated a manipulator for decades, hiding behind him to lead, handing him the power to achieve his darkest goals on a plate.

Above all, Vlamdir hated Albus Dumbledore immensly, the man who had manipulated everyone to change wizarding Britain into his playground…

In the young Russian's mind, Albus Dumbledore and the Ministry for Magic was responsible for his parents' deaths, as well as Neville's parents' madness, and Voldemort's first rise to power…
All those ills that could have been avoided if competent people, of Amelia Bones's caliber, were wholy leading the Ministry.

In truth, Vlamdir wanted one thing.
One thing that most of the time, even the people closest to him forgot.
He wanted to avenge his parents.
He wanted to avenge the two being who could have given him so much, and who were dead because of incompetent people.
Incompetent people who were not aware, or did not want to become aware, of the emergence of a Dark Lord.

Even if he never really knew them, he had some memories that he preciously kep in a secret room deep in his mind.
His mother's smell.
His father's laugh.
The silkiness of a ginger strand of hair, a pair a round glasses over laughing hazel eyes, as soap bubbles surrounded him.
Meager memories, that he had cherished, since he was raised in a clan in which memory was core to everything.

What better vengeance on the wizarding world than placing a disinterested man in power, severe but just, neither Pure-Blood nor Muggle-Born: a Half-Blood?
A man who could reestablish equality and freedom in a jaded and declining world?
What better vegeance than stealing true power from under Dumbledore's nose and permanently deposing him?

Vlamdir wanted to take revenge.
For his pride, for his family's honour.
And for this, he would place Severus Prince on the British throne.

Severus Prince would become king, whatever the cost, to get his revenge on Dumbledore.

<hr>

Kevin Entwhistle looked his best friend from the corner of his eyes.
If there was only one thing he knew, it was observing.
The young Muggle-Born noted everything, registered every detaul, and especially, analyzed all the data.
Vlad said that he was the perfect Ravenclaw.

Best student in his year, closely followed by Hermione, then Draco, his academic success did not make him prideful, and he stayed modest.
He preferred to hide in the shadows, intervening only when necessary.
Vladmir, still in the top 10 despite low marks in Transfiguration, knew that he could rely on him.

For now, Kevin could see the spark of hatred and anger in his eyes.
He only needed to follow his gaze to see it fixed on the small band of the leaders of the Ministry for Magic.
Strangely, Cornelius Fudge was not there, although he was convinced to have seen him a few minutes earlier.

Letting his eyes wonder over the room, Kevin took the time to memorize the people present, the groups, and most of all, he looked at people's eyes.
Indeed, while a face could be neutral, Kevin had learned a long time ago that the eyes reflected the sool, and that it was very difficult to hide feeling inside.

He had seen fear on her mother's smiling face enough, hatred in his brothers' while they apparently worried about hil…
The only people that he knew could master the emotions in their eyes could be counted on one hand.
Katya and Vlamdir Kemenov, Severus Prince, and Filius Flitwick.
For the latter, he knew it was because of the Goblin culture.
For the three wizards and witch, it was due to their life style.
Being a Mirage was not relaxing, and especially not safe.
How many dead wizards and witches had died because they wore the Courts' tattoos?

Kevin, young Knight-Mage vassal to the Potter line, stopped his gaze on a few minutes on a dog calmly lying down in the shadows, then turned his gaze towards his friend and equal, whose eyes feflected calmness, power, and pride.

Hermione was like him.
A mere Mudblood in the middle of a Pure-Blood reception.
A stain on the soirée's perfection.
But like him, she did not care, and proudly shone at Draco's arm, using impeccable manners that she had learned and practiced for hundreds of hours.

For her, for himself, he wanted an egalitarian work.
Him, who Vladmir and some members of society had accepted immediately while others belittled.
Him, who had finally found a family in the magical world.

To keep his family, to help misunderstood and rejected Muggle-Borns like him, he would help Vlamdir take revenge and power.
He would help him build an new wizarding world.
He would help bring back the monarchy.

He would help bring back the monarchy, whatever the cost, to support his friends and his wizarding family.

<hr>

Hermione Granger was a young witch with a sharp mind.
She could not consider herself a Muggle-Born any more, as a certain vampire clan chief had insisted.
But she was still considered as such by the whole of the wizarding world, her status as a Magical Creature begin kept secret.

As she looked at the Five Families dominate the ball, she felt some kind of pride for having behaved correctly enough to not harm her prestigious partner.
She could not hold back her smile, especially when she and Kevin's exchanged a glance.
He smiled back to her, then turned his head towards Severus Prince.
She did the same, and her pride changed into curiosity.

Her Licorine nature screamed at her to bring back the monarchy, to support the arrival of the Wizard-king.
Dame-à-la-Licornes had always supported the monarchs in the world.
Circe, powerful Dark witch and consort of a king, supported him until he died of poison at one of his sons's hand.
Morgan and Vivian, surrounding Artus…

Her English girl nature could only agree with her Licorine side.
Muggle Britain still was led by a Monarch, even if the country was a constritutional monarchy, to avoid hegemony by the royals.
She was deeply attached to it, and had been shocked to learn that the wizarding world was not led by the Queen of the United Kingdom, but by an popularly elected Minister for Magic.

Although no one admitted to her the identity of Artus's descendant, it was obvious for a Dame-à-la-Licorne.
Severus Prince was the future king.
Distractedly, she noted that Kevin was moving to a corner.

Hermione could only support what she guessed was was going on behind this first appearance of the Court of the Wizard-King.
She would support the monarchy, whatever the cost, by political conviciton.

<hr>

Sirius, in dog form, was dozing in a corner of the ball rooom.
While he loved the polite parties, attending under his dog appearance was not his cup of tea.
He sighed deeply and distractely looked around, trying not to scratch this horrible green collar that Sirius had given him.

A group of former classmates were talking with each other.
He recognised a few Ravenclaws he barely ever talked to…
In fact, he had never talked to them, when he thought about it.
However, in his mind, he had had classes with them, so why…
Ah, right, this Houses story.
The eagles were too… snobbish and uptight to catch the Gryffindors' attention.
However, it appeared that this had changed, judging from their company.
Sully McMillan was talking with an average height, but incredibly charsimatic man…
Probably her husband, judging from how intimatly he held her waist, and he was a former Slytherin…

Sirius sighed as a flashback of his flight came back to him.
He was traversing the Muggle London, and a couple of lovers had given him a piece of sandwich when he had needed it…
And suddenly, he panted when a dangerous parallel formed in his mind…

The huge crowd in London…
The huge elementary school he had seen, that was big enough to house the full seven years of Hogwarts students.

Sirius Black's fur bristled in fear, a more feline than canine reaction, but that corresponded more to his goosebumps.
Were wizards and witches so few?
Were they so devastated because of the previous wars?
The memories of the number of his friends who dieed in the previous war invaded his mind.
In his year, out of the 15 Gryffindors, Alice and Frank Longbottom were not sane any more, James and Lily Potter were dead.
Mary and Sarash died during their last year in Hogwarts, massacred with the rest of their family by Voldemort's men.
And to say that this madmass even killed his own…

How many families had disappeared in three generations of the wizarding world?
According to his grandparents, Hogwarts, when they were children, was full.
When he was there, half of the castle was unoccupied…
And now…
Three quarters?

The British wizarding world dying, so quickly!

"Shush, BLack…"

Sirius barely avoided jumping and felt a hand softly pet his head.
He recorgnised the young Muggle-Born and best friend of his godson, Kevin, if he remembered correctly.
Moaning, the dog put his head on the forearm marked by the Knight-Mage tattoo and observed the Five Families finally reunited.
Then, dragged by the boy, he joined the stairs and the most powerful wizards and witches in Britain.

The old stories his horrible mother had told him maybe had some element of truth.
The Five Families were the hope of the wizarding world.
Whatever the cost, he would do what he could to save it…
Even reestablish the monarchy if he had to.

<hr>

Lost in the crowd of wizards and witches, Cornelius Fudge, Minister for Magic, talked with those he mentally called dogsbodies.
Only bootlickers who bribed him handsomly to pass a law here and there.
He sometimes made happy, but he greatly enjoyed having a stubborn adversary in Amelia Bones.
When he did not like the demands that went with the bribes, he then said that this terrible Head of the Department of Law Enforcement threw a spanner in the works…

Ministers Fudge was telling the latest joke he had heard during one of the little parties his wife had organized when whispers rose up.
Mentally fulminating the imbeciles who dare interrupt his tirade, he was unpleasantly surprised to see a show that he never wished to witness…

The Five Families, gathered at the top of the honour stairs, overooking them, proud and noble.
If only he knew which of them was the heir in them, he would have tried to get rid of them quickly.
Indeed, Cornelius Fudge really like his seat.

The Minister clenched his teeth when he saw a young Hogwarts student.
He was ready to bet that that blasted Vlamdir Kemenov was the Heir.
Indeed, he had a grudge against the young Russian…
He had dared to belittle him, in front of witnesses!
Whatever, Cornelius maybe had some kind of revenge ready, as an idea sprouted in his head.

"Tsss," he impreceptibly whispered, knowing perfectly well that someone would hear him.

"Is something wrong, Minister?" his secretary worried.

The Minister held back a small satisfied smiled, and looked at the podgy woman who had a toad's smile with a contrite smile.
Merlin knew he did not like that woman.
However, Dolores Umbridge was so servile and eager for power that she looked over what she saw going over her desk as Secretary to the Minister.

"This sight pains me so much, dear…"

"They are the Five Families, Cornelius!" the Head of the Department of Health and Magical Research tooke offence, one, of the best Mediwizards of his generation.

"You are misinterpreting by words," the Minister for Magic sighed, falsly saddened.
"What pains me is seeing Amelia with two known Death Eaters and a wich coming from a line openly for Dark Magic!"

Whispers rose up around him, and Cornelius Fudge, satisfied, swallowed a mouthful of an excellent champagne.
He had forgotten how good Augusta's receptions were.
The Champagne was excellent, the amuse-bouche were divine.
As for the setting…
It had been a long time since any one had admired Longbottom Manor's ballroom, although it was not as impressive and magnificiently decorated as he remembered.

Cornelius Fudge felt a smile stretch his lips, seeing that his words perturbed some around him, and he hid his rictus to avoid attention.
How easy it was to manipulate everyone…

"Wha…?"

"Look… it'…"

"By Merlin!"

The Minister for Magic impercetibly frowned as he turned to the staris, the source of this sudden agitation.
Only his perfectly mastered manners despite his clumsy looks and his many, voluntary, faux-pas prevented him from spitting out the mouthful of vintage Champagne he had just sipped.

Augusta Longbottom was holding Lucius Malfoy's arm, and a Muggle-Born accompanied the young Draco!
As the two clans joined the Five Families, Cornelius pinched his lips.
What was Lucius doin?
He had always thought that the Lord tried to use him to ensure Pure-Blood supremacy, a goal he agreed with.
That was why Lucius Malfoy considered him as a simple puppet, as did most wizards and witches, because he praised every single one of his words…

He excused himself and slightly walked away from his collaborators, professing a most human and natural need.
He actually isolated himself between two pillars and his smile became mean.

Many forgot that Cornelius Fudge had been a Slytherin, Head Boy, and especially, leader of his House as Lucius Malfoy hadbeen decades laters, as was his son now.
Many forgeot that behind his puppet façade, he was a crafty man.

The smile the Minister for Magic was his true face.
Hidden between two statues, he observed the huge chessboard of power, on which the pieces formed coalitions.
Former Death Eaters, Conservatives, Democrats, Liberators…
Most united into political parties, showing their allegiances, but now, Fudge needed to take into account a new camp…
The Royalists.
And he even would meddle into their business.
He sipped once more on his Champagne, and took a resolution, before joining his little group again.

He would thus stand against the Five Families, whatever the cost, because it was the best for his interests.

<hr>

Sergei had observed the humans' smallest reactions‑as well as those of the few magical creatures skilfully hidden amongst the wizardsa and witches to avoid being chased away.
He was hidden behind a series of status, using his vampiric gifts to hide in the shadows.

Proudly, he had observed Vlamdir and Katya stand with the other members of the Five Families.
It pleased him to see that Vlamdir slowly was taking his place in the British magical world.

Sergei Dimitrovitch Pokhastovine was one of the most powerful vampires in Russia.
Indeed, not everyone could be Clan Chief of St-Petersburg, the city of Tsars.
And he had bee associated with the Kemenovs for three of their generations.
Katya's grandfather was a great man, and a great clan leader.
Katya, taking over, had revealed herself to be as charismatic and strong as he was, and the young Vlamdir was also shaping into a quite charismatic future leader himself.

However, the man next to him piqued his curiosity.
Sergei knew the man by name and reputation.
Cornelius Fudge was supposedly a puppet.
However, the manipulating smile and look the man had alerted the vampire.

He did not have a proper visual contact to enter his mind like he wanted to.
Not without showing himself.
However, Sergei knew this kind of people.
He knew very few genious manipulators, but they always had a kind of look and a gift to look like idiots.
The news of the Five Families must have upset him greatly to make him reveal himself.

Sergei stayed immobile as the man took his idiot face back and rejoined his collaborators.

The Russian got out of his hiding spot and carefully weaved in and out, before freezing, his senses alert.
He sharply turned his head to the entrance of the ballroom.
Amos Digorry and two other people stood there.
Sergei clenched his teeth, his eyes turning red in anger.

Had the Kemenov Matriarch dared to do that?
Did she really invite Valerius Dominis?
The Clan Chief of London was a tall vampire with platinum blond hair, as blond as Lucius Malfoy, and he stared back at Sergei.
The latter could see hatred in the eyes of his English rival, and he turned towards the third man.
Tall, ginger, blue eyes with a very familiar annoying sparkle.

Sergei blinked, and when he opened his eyes again, the man had disappeared.
The Russian Vampired clenched his teeth harder, and pressed towards the royalist alliance that had formed in front of their eyes.

He had to tell his friends that not only would the Five Families have to fight Dumbledore, and that he was certain he had seen him tonight.
But also, they had a new enemy in Cornelius Fudge.

Splitting the crows, the vampire mentally recited the oath of allegiance that he had sworn to Vassili and Katya Kemenov.
He would protect Katya and the Kemenov clan, and by extenstion, the Five Families, whatever the cost.
