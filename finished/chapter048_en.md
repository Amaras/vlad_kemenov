# Chapter 48: A Peculiar Defence Against the Dark Arts Lecture

Neville was calmly sitting down in the Gryffindor Common Room next to Ron and Hermione.
His friends were playing a suspenseful game of chess ‑ after all, the game was opposing Ron's strategic genius and Hermione's sharp intellect.
Meanwhile, still keeping an eye on the game, the Longbottom heir was reading the Daily Prophet with a pleasure he never knew he could have.

Because for the first time in very long years, the headlines were interesting, perfectly sourced, and totally objective.

And above all, Neville sniggered mentally, no article from Rita Skeeter was published.
From what his grandmother had told insinuated, the former star journalist of the Prophet had serious trouble, including complaints about her selective moral code.
A loud trial would come soon enough.

However, it was not the only change the journal had seen, far from it.
An international column was created, the political section was finally coherent, and the society section was true for the first time in centuries.

_A new Government chosen by our Minister for Magic!_ the headlines said, with a photograph of Lucius Malfoys along with Amelia Bones and Damocles Rowle.

Neville had read the article in full, noticing that some known people were not Heads of a department any more.
On the other hand, the appearance of several unknowns in the main management of the Ministry had made many Pure-Blood and students raised in the magical world gossip during breakfast.

However, after painstakingly studying the article for nearly two hours, the analysis was simple.
Three days after the snap elections and the Lord Malfoy's inauguration as Minister for Magic, several things had changed in the British society.
Nothing obvious, and it was a master stroke that the new ministerial cabinet had managed…
The taking in hand of the Prophet had been done softly, under the threat of legal action if the Editorial Board decided to continue publishing lies.
The nomination of the new Heads of Departments had been done astutely, putting forward several political figures coming from different parties.
All were satisfied et it had been done coherently: for instance not racist Pure-Blood was Head of the Departement for the Regulation and Control of Magical Creatures.
Amelia Bones was still Head of Magical Law Enforcement, Damocles was Head of International Cooperation…

Finally…
Neville stood up calmly, folding the paper and smiled at Hermione, who had looked up from the board, a question visible in her eyes.

"I'm going to see Vlad."

Hermione nodded and returned to the game, carefully observing Ron's last move, quite menacing for her queen.

Neville got out of his Common Room and brushed the Alliance Galleon in his pocket as soon as he passed through the Fat Lady portrait.
Like all the members of their little group, they had always kept them since Hermione and Kevin had created them.
It was their way to always be in contact with one another, and especially to know where they were in case of a problem.

«Vlad?» he called mentally.

«Yes, Neville?» the Russian immediately answered.

«Are you in your Common Room?»

«In the HQ with Severus.
We're working on a heredity potion.
Severus is not letting go and is convinced that the Entwhistles had wizarding ancestors, he wants to go up to Merlin.»

The young Longbottom rolled his eyes in amusement at the obstinacy Severus showed, especially after he had noticed how smart young Mary-Ann was with Potions…
Kevin's young sister had shocked the Potions Master when she made the potion in hald the time, instinctively findings the ingredients to accelerate the process without exploding.
Needless to say, the Head of Slytherin was euphoric at inheriting this rare gem in his House.

As he climbed down the stairs of Gryffindor Tower and reached the Entry Hall, Neville greeted a group of Slytherin first years who came up from the Dungeons.
Neville was one of the rare Gryffindor students who had gained the respect from the whole of Slytherin, independantly of his friendship with Draco.
Apparently, the fact that he had defended Clarisse Selwyn, only daughter in Lord Slewyn's three children, had been told all through the Dungeons.
The fact that she was the adored princess of the largest Pure-Blood family in England had played in his favour.
Since the Selwyn themselves numbered around forty, and around ten members by alliance, it formed of the families with the most connections.

«Neville?» Vladmir called him, worried by the lack of response.

«Sorry, I was lost in my thoughts.
Want to help me with the Devil's Snares and some Bubotubers?»

«Bubotubers?
Are you sure about that?» Vlad sighed mentally.
«Alright, I'm coming!
Give me five minutes to tell Severus and come up!»

Neville could only snigger as he remembered this years first Herbology class, where they had to squeeze the Bubotubers pustules to collect a foul-smelling and stinging pus.

Without hurrying, enjoying this nice Saturday morning still warm for an end of September, Neville walked to the park.
It had been a while since he had last taken the time to help Professor Sprout in the greenhouses.
The last time had been just before the summer break, to tidy up before the departure of the gardener's apprentices that were the students.
Neville did not count is time in greenhouse 8 1/2, which hid the incredible Hufflepuff Common Room, and which was linked to the castle by a secret passaged that ended up next to the kitchens.

On the way, as he was walking along the castle towards Professor Sprout's domain, he saw the Black Lake and its water hiding roves of magical aquatic plants.
Neville thought with a smile that he would maybe get a look the next morning, and maybe, he could manage to have Vladmir follow!

Walking past the hut of the Groundskeeper, he waved at Alfred Sawlings, with whom he had spent long talking about plants and Herbology.
The man knew a lot, especially the local plants.
They had ended up exchanges a few quite specialized books and thus, Neville had been able to borrow a rare grimoire about the aquatic plants of the Mediterranean basin.

Neville had just sat down inside greenhouse 4 and put on his protective apron around his neck when Vladmir arrived in turn.

To his surprise, the Russian was only wearing a simple shirt, whose tail had been carelessly pushed inside his silk toursers.
But more than the careless aspect of the Russian, it was his sleeves casually pushed up and showing several gross scars on his arms that caught the Gryffindor's attention.

Seeing the knife marks brought back bad memories to Neville's mond.
He perfectly remembered the state of his friend during the duel opposing him to a shifty Russian, who had influcted him most of the wounds that were visible on his forearms.
However, Neville was relieved to see that the Mirage Court's particular camouflage was activated.
Him alone could see the Russian Court's tattoo on his friend's forearm, along with the crown that marked his as a Prince of the _Semirrov_.

"You want to scare the others?" Neville laughed as he pointed to this best friend's naked arms?

"Exactly," Vladmir mumbled, sitting down in front of him.
"Especially the girl population of Hogwarts."

"Welcome to the club of eligible rich heirs!" the heir to the very noble House Longbottom sniggered as Vlad sighed deeply.

Both of them, as well as Draco, had indeed started to get more attention from their female school friends since they came back from the holidays.
It was well known that the three men had no official engagement, and they all had a quite advantageous growth spurt in the summer…

"Grandmother wants me to choose a fiancée before the end of the year," Neville sighed, holding out pruning sheers and a bunch of clay pots to take cuttings from the Devil's Snares while he would take care of the Bubotubers.
"And I think they all learned about it, one way or another…"

"I should have kept the engagement with Susan until I was of age," Vladmir agreed.
He remembered, still horrified, the lovelorn gazes Ron's sister had given him.
Because of her friendship with Luna, the youngest Weasley had manaed to approach him closer, and had been quite insistant until Ron got things straight with his sister.

"On one hand, this contract was not valid," Neville giggled.

"Yeah, but they didn't need to know it…
The traditions concerning the Five Families are all but forgotten for the average wizard.
No one would have noticed!"

Indeed, an unknown fact was that the members of the Five Families could not mary among themselves to avoid mixing the lines.
It was also why they avoided having multiple heirs, since the women could pass on the title.
They cut down on the parallel branches of the same family, because in the end, they would all be unable to find partners without anyu family relation, and the Families would disappear.
The Rowles were the only exception in centuries, and only their close circle knew taht Damocles had nearly repudiated his wife when he had learned that she had bypassed his order and took a fertility potion to get pregnant again…
However, it did not prevent him from deeply loving his children.

Lost in their thoughts, the two heirs started to cut the Devil's Snares and collect the Bubotuber pus, working in an appeasing silence.
They were each in their own world, enjoying to peace in the greehouse.

"Who did you kill for your Court Initiation?" Vladmir asked suddenly, who had been looking at Neville's naked tattoo.

Neville startled, surprised by the directness of the question, and especially the fact that he asked it in the middle of the greenhouses, where anyone could hear him.

"Who said I killed someone?"

Neville was not wrong by asking.
Not all aspirants had an assassination as a mission to be intronated in the Mirage Court.
It could be a theft, an extorsion, or simply a specific information search.

"You come from a Master Line specialized in poisons," Vladmir smirked, "you only need a bit of logic."

"Cassiopeia Black," Neville murmured.

Vladmir stayed silent for a few minutes, processing the news.
He knew his family's lineage perfectly well, and Cassiopeia Black was James Potter's aunt, and therefore his great-aunt.
Neville had drastically cut back the rare members of the British family he had.
He felt a pinch in his heart, even though he had never met the old witch because of her loyalty to her family's motto: "Always Pure".
Neither katya, _atrocious bastard_, nor him, _miserable Half-Blood_, were worthy of her attention.

"During the 1992 summer break?" he suspected.

Neville had not yet been Initiated when they entered Hogwarts, although he bore the Court's tattoo because he belonged to a Master Line, while he was a full member of the new _Undeground_ the very next year.

"Indeed, she wanted to short-change one of the Longbottoms' main suppliers, who chose to ask for our family's talents.
Sorry…"

"She may have been my great-aunt, be she was too attached to the Blacks' motto, and I never knew her.
Don't worry about it."

"What about you?"

"Gregorovitch."

"I remember," Neville whispered, thinking back to the article that had been published by the Daily Prophet during the 1991 summer.
"Nice staging."

"He tried to steal the _Mirazh_.
At the time, it was still a branch of the Russian Court, so they asked me to make an example out of him for our other partners."

After those little confidences, the two students returned to their work, careful to correctly treat their respective plats.
The fact that those two kinds of plants were twisting to try to strangle or trap them was not helping, but it was something that made gardening interesting.

"You seem worried for the start of lectures," Neville said eventually.

Vlamdir stayed silent and cut a Devil's Snare creeper before putting some magical fertilizer on the fresh cut and transplating the cutting an another pot, cursing in his mind.
Neville knew him too well, as well as Kevin did.
He did not know, however, thtat the two wizards had talked about his gloomy mood between lectures.

"Katya thinks the Dark Mage associated with Dumbeldore is Grindelwald," the Russian declared.

"He's locked up in Nurmendard," Neville said with surprise.

"Was.
He disappeared thirty or so years ago, according to the guards.
The prison houses many prisoners, but not him."

"What do you mean?"

"He officially died in 1962.
Katya made her own enquiries with the help of the Austrian Court.
She thinks that he never stayed there, and more importantly, she is convinced that they have spent all this time plotting to take power over the European wizarding world."

neville stayed silent of ten minutes, trying to put all context in this right place, with all he knew before.
Then, once he had time to summarize everything, he started.

"So Dumbledore and Grindelwald would have lied to the whole magical world?"

"Yes."

"They would have schemed Voldemort's rise?"

"Probably."

"To hide their own schemes?"

"Probably."

"And finally, to allow Dumbeldore to get all the important positions that we knew thanks to his so-called prestige and his Light persona?"

"Yes."

"Why?"

"Since Dumbeldore became Headmaster, the level fell drastically.
Since Dumbeldore became Chief Warlock of the Wizengamot, laws favouring wizards against other magical creatures increased, as did the ones favouring Pure-Bloods.
Since Dumbledore became Supreme Mugwump of the International Confederation of Wizards, strangely, the ICW nearly completely disappeared from the British political scene.
They tried to created a fundamentally racist society, made up of a leading caste and an ingorant mass, which they would lead," Vladmir concluded.
"A disguised dictatorship."

Neville stayed silent and eventually put away the cutting pots they had done.
The sun was shining in the greehouse, givin it an appeasing warmth, although he felt cold as he realized how extensive the man's manipulations were.
Apparently, Dumbeldore had played remarkable moves, using Britain as a giant chessboard.
Setting aside the Five Families, who could be the source of many constraints, he had established himself on multiple fronts: political, social, educational…

"Something feels off…" the Gryffindor said after some time.

"Why was Dumbeldore so open and nearly a caricature of his villain role?" Vlad whispered, expressionless.

"Indeed.
He tried to keep you under his heel so obviously, and I'm not even talking about his intrusion into our social like in Hogwarts.
It was so overacted…"

Vlamdir could only agree.
Neville had pointed out the main thing that did not fit this theory.
Albus Dumbeldore's personality had been shown during the trials, and the enormous misdemeanours he had done since Vladmir Kemenov, aka Harry Potter, had appeare d on the British scene were too large to fit with Katya's suspicions.

"Yes."

"I don't know… but it's feeling off, as if…" Vlad added.

"As if he wanted to get every one's attention on himself and let Grindelwald go unnoticed?" Neville whispered.

Vlamdir slowly nodded and Neville sighed.

"You're wrong.
It doesn't feel off, it is lethel.
Voldemort still alive, Dumbeldore plotting with Grindelwald…
Vlad?"

"Yes?"

Neville's face was deathly serious.

"Do you think all three are allies?"

"Non.
Voldemort is not the kind to share power…" the Russian murmured.

"So we have two enemies to bring down," the Longbottom heir whispered.

"It's not the only thing," Vladmir sighed.
Neville had felt his unease, but Katya's suppositions were not the only thing to undermined him.

"What more?
Nothing worse, I hope?" Neville suddenly worried.

"Voldemort and his Horcruxes."

Neville frowned.
The existance of those purely Dark magic object was a secret that the whole Alliance core knew since their first year.
Vladmir had not hidden why Voldemort survived, especially after they had met the bein that the former Dark Lord had become several times during the next years.

"You already destroyed to journal's…
You think he made two?"

Two Horcruxes, it meant a soul devided in three.
And three was a logical number, full of power and magic.

"No, I think he made seven."

Neville furrowed his brows with an evident suprise.
Seven Horcruxes?
Eight was one of the weakest numbers in Numerology.
Not prime, its only magical virtue was the presence of a trilogue, which Muggle usually called a cubed number.

"Six voluntary and one accidental," Vladmir added, as if he understood his friend's surprise.

Six was more logical in its magical power.

"An accidental one?
How could he create a Horcrux acc…"

Neville's gaze went to Vladmir's forehead and he grew quite pale.
He was far from stupid…

"You… You are a Horcrux?" he stuttered.

"I am.
I talked a bit with the only living Horcrux I knew, but I did not get much information from her," Vlad murmured, thinking about his conversation with Grigori Rasputin and his wife.

> Vlamdir was standing in the home of the Rasputin couple, although home was a weak word to describe how gorgeous the place was.
The Immortal and his wife life in the most famous monastery in Saint-Ptersburg, which was perfect considering he wizard's former religious vocation.
Grigori Rasputin had though, before learning about magic, that his gifts were God-given and had given part of his life to religion…
Until he had learned at that a parallel world existed, the wizarind world.
>
> He was drinking tea with Praskovia Fedorovna Rasputina, waiting that her husband finished reading his weekly correspondance.
> The most powerful Dark Mage in Russia had regular letters with many wizards and magical creatures around the world, and even a good number of Muggle scientists.
> Rasputin was one of the rare wizards who could brag he knew the incredible Muggle advances in science and technology…
> He was also one of the rare ones who had electricity.
> His only regret, according to himself, was the lack of television.
> It seemed the electromagnetic and magical waves were not compatible, a problem he had already spent ten years searching for a solution…
>
> Well, Vladmir Vassilievitch, what can I do for you?" the Dark mage calmly asked, sitting down nect to his wife after he had tenderly kissed her temple.
> One thing was clear, even after 100 years living together, they still loved each other intensely…
>
> I have a few questions concerning Horcruxes, Grigori Effimovitch," the young Russian declared respectfully, looking at his elders.
>
> "Quite the dark domain," the Dark Mage whispered.
> "What do you want to know?"
>
> "How can I get rid of the parasite?" Vladmir asked abruptly.
>
> "Vladmir!" Praskovia looked horried.
>
> "I amm deeply sorry for offending you Praskovia Fedorovna," Vlad sighed with a contrite smile.
> "However, while you have knowingly accepted to house part of your husband's sould, allowing you both to be immortal, it is not the case for me, and I consider this sould as a parasite."
>
> "For now," Rasputin sighed, "I cannot help you, Vladmir.
> I am looking to free you from this unwanted sould, but the only solution I found involves your death, and I doubt you want that."
>
> Vladmir swore under his breath, getting told of by the Dark Mage's wife, who had raised three children and did not appreciate hearing youngsters swearing like sailors.
>
> "However, I think that should you manage, through meditation, to brush the sould parasiting you, you might detect the other Horcruxes," Rasputin declared.
>
> "What do you mean?"
>
> "Praska had a quite impressive knowledge of my sould, and it has somewhat fused with her.
> Since then, I can approximately know her location and her mine.
> I do not ask of you to do the same, but you should think about grasp your… undesirable guest… more fully.

Neville grimaced at the implications of this conversation with one of the most powerful Dark Mages in Russia.

"So in concrete terms, if you understand and accepts the Horcrux in you enough, you'd be able to detect the others," Neville summarized, making Vlad nod slowly.

"Rasputin advised against approaching the parasite alone.
I must be accompanied by someone, preferably a Master Occlumens;"

"Severus?"

"Or Rasputin.
Bu Severus is closer," Vlad smiled half-heartedly.
"I need to talk to him."

And on this, they left the greehouse to go to lunch in the Great Hall.
They then met in a turn of a corner a character that had become a true attraction for the students…
Professor Alastor Moody, also known as Mad-Eye Moody.

The relationship between the Ravenclaw and their Defence Against the Dark Ars professor was quite surprising: a mix of rancour and respect.

The Alliance had ended up understanding the reasons of the rancour the former Auror had against Vladmir when the latter had told them about their meetings.

The first, the on in Knockturn Alley, had happened right after Vladmir had summoned the Wild Hunt on Felix Demetrovitch Darerine.
While the Alliance had laughed at the Auror chasing the two Russians, the rest had worried them.
Moody knew that Vladmir had cast the curse, as he had openly told him a few days later.
But above all, Vlamdir had hurt his honour.
Alastor Moody, the year of his retirement, had been simply knocked out and abandonned on the steps to the Ministry for Magic by a thirteen-year-old child.

However, despite this rancour, the man seemed to worry for Vladmir.
To see the child collaspe during the trial under the effect of an old curse had shaken Moody and eventually, after he had spent nearly a month speding part of the time with the small group of students, this worry had extended to the other Alliance members and their families.
He was was the one who prevented an aggression on Mary-Ann by a few seventh-year Slytherins in the corridors a few days into the years.
The young Muggle-Born had lauded the Transfiguration talents of the former Auror, without noticing her brother's and Draco's threatening gazes.
Or she had deliberately ignored them…
And when, the next day, Augusta had declared that three seventh-year Slytherins had ended un in the Hospital Wing because of a forbidden duel, Mad-Eye Moddy simply smiled at the Professors' table, his gaze on Kevin…

In the end, Professor Moody was slightly wary of Vlad and regularly sniped at him in the middle of lectures, but he kept reasonable and always payed attention to safety.

And the Alliance had been relieved, as they had worried that he would have hated Vlad like Minerva McGonagall had for their first two years.
The former Auror was not on the same level as the Transfiguration Professor.

"Professor Moody," Neville greeted him.

"Longbottom, Kemenov," the Professor mumbled, limping towards them.
"I have an announcement for you two."

"Come on, Professor," Neville encouraged him, while Vladmir simply raised a questionning eyebrow.

"You are spending too much time with Snape," Moody said to the Russian.
"He's rubbing off on you."

"What did you expect, he is a member of the Five Families and a close friend," Vlad answered casually.
"Your announcement?"

"Unforgivables…"

"Pardon?"

"The next lecture will be on the Unforgivables, with demonstrations.
I wanted to tell you before because of your… precedents…" the old wizard said gruffily.
"And I count on you to participate…"

Vladmir and Neville looked at each other then thanked the Professor for his sincerity, as the latter simply sniffed and walked back to his classroom.
Neville could now stand the sight of Dark Magic hexes, but no one had tried to cast a _Cruciatus_ curst in front of him, nor any other Unforgivable.
As to make them participate… how did he think he would do that?
That was the question that the two friends pondered.

"Occlumency," Vlad whispered.

"Yeah, I'm gonna spend lunch break working on my shields," Neville sighed.

<hr>

And thus, with a certain apprehension, Neville, shouldered by Vlad, Hermione, and Kevin, walked to the Defence Against the Dark Arts classroom.
Professor Moody had spent the first two weeks getting all his classes up to the level that the official curriculum required for their year.
Two intensive weeks.

When they arrived, the former Auror was already in the room, looking at the Gryffindors and Ravenclaws enter.

Alastor Moody noted the way Neville's friends were bracketing him, taking care to go to the back of the room.
He was still astounded by how heterogenous the small group was, espeecially since he could also young Susan Bones and Theodore Nott join them sometimes.
However, he could not deny that they were an extremely tight-knit group.
He only had to remember how badly the three seventh-year Slytherins who had tried to assault the young Entwhistle girl were hurt.

A smile stretched the wizard's mutilated lips at the thought of the three injured students.
One would never be able to walk without a cane, and they all had had red and gold hair for three weeks now… and he was sure that Vladmir Kemenov had nothing to do with those attacks.

"Good, starting from now, you can put your books away," Moody groaned.
"Has someone taken the time to tell you the full Defence Against the Dark Arts curriculum during your three years of study?"

Some negative whispers made him sighed.
What had Albus Dumbledore done for all those years?
Quirell had died in strage circumstances in the middle of the castle and was totally incompetent.
Lockhart, he preferred not thinking about.
Only Lupin had been decent, and he had sent him his lessons through owl mail.

"To say it simply, the first three years are supposed to teach you how to defend yourselves against the most common Dark creatures.
It also corresponds to the average length of time necessary to tame your internal magic.
By learning simple defensive spells, you will not exhaust your magical potential, and especially you learn how to stay focused in face of danger.
The next two years, you will learn defensive and offensive spells, as well as the history of the main Dark Mages and the different types of magic used in fights.
Finally, your last years will be centered on duelling, in collaboration with the Duelling professor, and you can also take the advanced Duelling option, like the Headmistress told you last year.
Any questions?"

A heavy silence rang out, and the former Auror let his discomforting gaze run over the students.
Their faces were attentive, with a slight apprehension.

"Good.
I have one year to teach you how to defend yourselves against most…"

"You won't be there next year?" Ron interrupted him with his usual eloquence.

"No, Mister Weasley, I see you have not listened carefully during our first class!" the Defense Against Dark Arts professor chuckled.

Ronald had the decency to blush, his cheeks starting to take the colour of his hair, while Hermione silently called him an idiot.

"As I said, I have one year to teach you a few practical defensive spells.
We have the luck to have among us one of the rare people in the British Isles who can freely use Dark Magic, including forbidden curses.
Mister Kemenov, would you agree to showing us a few spells?"

"Wait, why are you asking Vlad?" Parvati wondered out loud, as Vlad was slightly pale.

"For the simple reason that I am going to show you the worst curses, before showing you the most common ones."

"You want to show us Dark Magic spells?" a Gryffindor went white.

"I do.
I want to show you so that you can recognised the type of light the spell emits, as well as the associated movement of the wand.
Thanks to those criteria, you will be able to recognize the spell and thus react accordingly in a duel.
However, even I cannot use some curses in Hogwarts without triggering all the alarms of the Ministry for Magic, contrary to our Russian friend.
Any one knows which curses I am talking about?
Mister Thomas?"

"I don't know," the Gryffindor cringed.

"Mist Turpin?"

"The three Unforgivable Curses?" the Ravenclaw tried.

"Exactly!
What are the the spells that the law suppresses the hardest, and why?
Longbottom?" Moody was surprised to see Neville raise his hand.

"The Cruciatus," the Longbottom heir said with a firm voice.
"It is a torture spell that can make someone mad quickly."

"Exactly.
One of the Death Eaters' favourite, very used during the war.
Another one?
Mister Weasley."

"The Impera… Imperius Curse, or something like that," Ron said.
"It suppresses the target's will and you become a puppet."

"Very good.
You probably heard about it through your father.
It made the Ministry's job difficult.
Finally, the last one?
Miss Granger?"

"The Deah curse.
Instantly kills the target.
Only one survivor is known to this day."

"And ironically, this same person is the only allowed to cast it," Professor Moody agreed, looking at Vladmir.
"Mister Kemenov?"

Vlamdir hesitated, but for once, Neville suprised their professor by softly pushing him to stand up.
The young Russian obeyed, his face taking on an emotionless mask as an icy wind went across the classroom.
Moody recognized the signature of Slavic magic, which had given their "polar mages" nickname to the Russian wizards.

"Guinea pig?" Vlad asked lifelessly.

Moody pointed to a jar, quite curius to see the young man use Dark Magic without any complex.

**"Open,"** Vlad whispered in Russian, pointing his wand without any flick of the wrist.
The cover unscrewed itself and a spider got out.

"_Engorgio._"

Under Moody's spell, the spider tripled in size, and he noticed Wealsey recoiling.
Then Vladmir successively cast the three spells.
Not a sound could be heard in the room as his classmates saw in turn the spider make improbable things, like gymnastics, then writhe in pain, before staying immobile after being hit by a spall the same green as the Russian's eyes.

"Thank you for your help, Heir Kemenov," Professor Moody declared slowly, as Vladmir went to sit back down, his classmates looking at him.
"Now that you have seen those three spells, I will explain to you a few very important differences.
Between Dark Magic, Dark Mage, and those commonly known as Dark Lords…"

He once again looked at students, seeing the worried faces, but also the attention they gave him.

"Dark Magic actually covers a set of magic necessitating a sacrifice," Professor Moody started slowly.
"The three Unforgivable curses are no exception to this rool.
The Imperius curse takes some of the target's mind as a payment, the Cruciatus part of the body by damaging the nerves, and the Death curse takes the sould and the mind of a wizard, killing them instantly.
All forms of Dark Magic require a payment, and that is the reason why Dark Magic is frowned upon.
However, giving a drop of your own blood to strenghten a spell is commonplace in many countries.
I have heard that Mister Kemenov has used a blood shield in his duel during your first year, which had the advantage of being stronger than most of our protection spells…"

Alastor Moody let the silence settle, satisfied to see the students think about his words.
The looks on Vladmir slightly changed, less wary.

"Good, now, let's talk about the Mage denomination.
Does any one know the difference between a Dark wizard and a Dark Mage, or betwenn a Light wizards and a Light Mage?"

Unsurprisingly, only Vladmir's friends raised their hands.

"Mister Entwhistle?"

"A wizard only uses his internal magic for spells, even if he uses an external catalyst like a sacrifice.
Most wizards cannot use all of their magical resources, or they die trying.
On the contrary, a Mage uses all of their internal magic, but can also used natural magic.
They thus have a bottomless source of magic.
A Light Mage will take their magic from the elements, while a Dark Mage will take from living beings."

"Excellent, Mister Entwhistle," their Defence Against the Dark Arts professor complimented him.
"Now, since our lecture is ending, I will ask of you two rolls of parchment on the difference between a Dark Mage and a Dark Lord.
I also want you to develop the difference between Dark and Light magic, and especially why a Dark wizard is not necessarily bad."

Vlamdir, even if he was only distractedly listening to the class, could not help but find the former Auror's change of opinion surprising.
Unless he had enough ethics to objectively teach Defence Against the Dark Arts despite his personal opinion.

However, because of Moody's lecture, Vladmir got new attention on him, like around his duel with the Fedovir mercenary.
Although, this time, no female student was approching him any more, except a few Slytherins that Vlad never wanted to see in the first place.

Then, before the Alliance had time to relize it, they found an announcement in the middle of the Entry Hall.
The crowd of students was quite dense around them.

"They are coming," Luna smiled, her arms on Mary-Anns shoulder, smiling dreamily.
The two girls got along famously, but Mary-Ann also got two precious friends ‑ not only in friendship but also in prestige: Clarise Selwyn, daughter of Lord Selwyn, and Leonis Lovegood, who was as excentric as his cousin Luna or his father Amiphilius, international reporter.
They two were Slytherins and Pure-Bloods from the high nobility who had taken the young Muggle-Born under their wings.

"Who?" the young Slytherin asked, while Leonis had the same dearmy smile as his cousin.

"The champions!" Leonis laughed.

"She is talking about the delegations," Kevin said, hugging the two girls, smiling to Leonis, a blond boy has small and thin as Luna.

"Does Cedric know?" Neville asked, arriving behind him with Hermione.

"Why?"

"He wants to register to be Hogwarts' champion," Vlamdir explained, walking towards them in turn, opening a path through the other students with his elbows to get to his friends.

"He can be," Hermione smiled.
"He is charismatic, intelligent, and he is one of the most respected Huffleuffs."

"So much admiration for our Hufflepuff," Draco sniggered.
"A sign of future love?"
