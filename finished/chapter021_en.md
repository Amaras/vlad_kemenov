## Chapter 21: The Premises of a network in Hogwarts

"So, Draco, is Dobby your mother's personal elf?" Vladmir asked him a month after the school year started.

The Malfoy heir looked at his friend, wrinkling his nose in a dicreet pout, although it was obvious for one who knew him.
Vlad had not forgotten the incident with the House Elf.
Draco had managed to not push the subject during their discussions, avoiding difficult subjects like those.
The Slytherin had been mortified when the Russian had become upset that say, although he feared repurcussions if it was indeed a Malfoy family elf.

"Yeah," he finally said, looking at the lake.
"My mother owns a House Elf named Dobby."

"Is he for her exclusive use?"

"Not that I know of..." the young noble conceeded.

Vladmir stayed silent for a few long minutes.

They were standing on the rocks of a small creek, at the mouth of the river and the lake.
This place was out of sight from the castle, as well as next to the Forbidden Forest.
Not many people dared to explore spots so close the the dark woods, especially this far from Hogwarts.
It was, however, one of the places that the two heirs prefered in the Hogwarts grounds, facing the dark waters of the lake.
Hermione had laughed when she had discovered where they were hiding, declaring it was just like Vlad: mysterious and wild.
The Scottish moor, arid and windswept on one side, the Forbidden Forest with its oppressive atmosphere on the other, with the lake like a liquid mirror in the middle, its surface as dark as their natural magic.

"Can you summon him please?"

Draco slowly turned to his friend.
He recognised how important this demand was in his friend's tone of voice, and it worried him, even if he didn't show anything.

"One can't Apparate in Hogwarts," Draco remarked.

The young Russian smiled, seemingly amused although his eyes stayed cold and serious.

"House Elves do not use magic like ours, Draco.
Hogwarts is accessible to them.

Draco sighed, and called Dobby firmly.
To his regret, his mother's elf appeared, wearing the family's livery and bowed down, ignoring Vlad who was behind his back.
Draco looked back at his friend, and sighed again.
According to the dark glow in his eyes, Dobby was undeniably the Elf that had broken into their St-Petersburg home.

"Dobby, shut up and stay immobile."

Vlad nodded to Draco, thanking him for his order and saw him shiver in response.
He had put his cold mask back on, and it made the blond one undeniably uneasy.

"Hello Dobby," Vladmir whispered, walking in front of the magical creature, "remember me?"

The House Elf was shaking, but he did not say a word and did not try to flee, under the constraint imposed by his young master's order.
However, anyone could see that terror was in every fibre of his being.
Draco gave pained grin.
Apparently, the Russian had made a strong impression on Dobby when they first met, and it pained Draco.
Even if he was not the most competent and bit wacky around the edges, he was a good servant and was part of his House.
He had to intervene before Vlad traumatised him...

"Let me interrogate him, please," Draco eventually said, a slight tint of torment in his voice that he cursed himself for detecting.

Vlad raised an eyebrow while looking at him, before slowly sitting back.
Draco gave him a tense smile, realising he had just asked a favour that his friend could have outright refused.
Dobby had offended the Kemenov Clan, by appearing without a coat-of-arms, and Vlad could have claimed his right of contempt adnd demand to do it himself...

"Dobby, "the young Malfoy murmurred.
"I order you to answer my questions.
Do you understand?"

"But...
If the Mistress..."


"Is Lady Malfoy married to Lucius according to the ancient marital laws?" Vlad cut him, thoughtful.

"Yes," Draco answered.
"But..."

"Then your orders as heir override hers.
Only your father and, in case of a different person, you Head of family can override yours."

Vlad smiled when he was Dobby swallow, uneasy.
Draco only looked at him, suprised.
He was not aware of this peculiarity in the ancient marital laws.
His Slytherin mind immediately took note of the advantages that it could bring him, and what better way to thank his friend than to give him what he wanted?

"You did you break into the Kemenov home?"

"I... Dobby has..." the small elf started, his eyes filled with tears.

"I demand to know the truth by my right as heir, Dobby.
Take your time to formulate your answer clearly and completely."

Vladmir pouted appreciatively.
He perfectly remembered the stutters the magical creature had last time and did not want to hear them again.
They were unbearable.
Dobby breathed in and out several times, and opened his huge and humid eyes to stare at his young master.

"Lady Malfoy has introduced a Dark Magic artifact in Hogwarts.
Dobby does not know what it is, but darkness was so present around the Mistress that it can only be bad.
She wants Mister Harry Potter-Kemenov to die."

"Why does she want me dead?"

"Answer Vladmir's questions, Dobby, it's better for you."

Once again, the elf took the time to think about his answer, then dared to look into Vladmir's eyes, respect and weariness in his eyes.

"Her master wants to come back.
You are Harry Potter-Kemenov, the Boy-Who-Lived."

Vlad saw Draco become pale when hearing about a master, while he grimaced upon hearing teh nickname the English newpapers had given him.
Draco stayed [upright] in front of his elf, pride taking over fear.
This new fact reminded him of the chat with his friends at the start of the year, and the Slytherin prayed that Dobby would answer negatively.

"Dobby, has mother gone to Russia this summer?"

"She has, the Mistress was gone for a week in Easter European countries.
She went to see friends, and take the opportunity of her transit in St-Petersburg to do some shopping."

"What friends?" the Malfoy heir asked with an emotionless voice.

"The Mistress visited Lady Dolohov and Lord Darerine."

"Ilyna Saprovna Dolohov and Felix Demetrovitch Darerine?"

Vladmir was increasingly interested, leaning forwards, his arms on his thoughs.
Dobby nodded silently as Draco closed his eyes.
He vaguely knew a Dolohov, a Death Eater locked away in Azkaban, but he never heard those two names.
Vladmir, on the contrary, seemed to know who those people were, and due to his dark eyes, the Slytherin did not want to know why.
Dejected, he hesitated to ask a question, _the_ question, but Vladmir asked it himself.

"Does Lord Malfoy know?"

"He does not.
The Mistress has told Dobby to say nothing to the masters, except if they specifically asked for the location of her holidays and the name of her friends."

"Do you have other questions, Vlad?" Draco weakly asked, praying for the discussion to be over soon.
To his horror, the Russian nodded, and he mentally prepared to recieve another bad news.

"Are you linked somehow to the incident on Platform 9 3/4?"

"Dobby is not, Sir.
However, a large-scale magical perturbation was felt by all magical creatures, Mister Harry Potter-Kemenov, Sir.
It was probably the cause of the disruption of magical transports."

Vlad looked at his friend and nodded slightly.
He did not have any more questions for the elf.
Draco dismissed him after having forbidden him from revealing the content of this discussion to his mother.
His face was then drained of any remaining colour it had let, and Draco collapsed on the rocks of the little creek, his eyes fixed on the water.

"My mother, Vlad...
What has my mother done?"

Vladmir kneeled next to him and put a comforting hand on his shoulder.
Narcissa Malfoy had met with two former lieutenants of Voldemort in Eastern Europe.
Vlad had to tell his aunt about the movements of Voldemort loyalists, and closely monitor what was happening in the school...

It was time to setup his chessboard, but in the meantime, he had to comfort his friend.
It took him some time, and he knew Draco was more affected than he wanted to let on.
Their meeting with the dark mage the previous year was still fresh in Draco's memory, and even if it was not traumatic, the danger was real.
The Slytherin had just lost his comforting illusions.
Only Lucius was known as a Death Eater, and Draco had just discovered that his mother was more involved that he believed.

A full hour after taht, Draco had finally regained his composure and went to his Transfiguration class with Gryffindor, while Vlad joined Kevin and the rest for a two-hour class of Defence Against Dark Arts.

His afternoon was definitely going to be crap, the Russian thought as he saw the classroom door open.
He gritted his teach while walking in.
He was angry before the class even started.
The furutre problems Narcissa Malfoy caused, notably the question of the Dark Magic artefact, were turning again and again in his mind.
Fortunately, he would have time to think about it without being bothered...

He had taken the decision to stay discreet from the moment of his first meeting with Lockhart in the greenhouses to avoid any harassment.
Since the beginning of the year, Kevin and Vlad were hiding at the back of the classroom, helped with a discreet but powerful spell that made them nearly disappear to the professor's eyes.
Thanks to that, he had managed to avoid the flagrant attention of the man on _Harry Potter_, even though Flitwick presumably had a few harsh words with Lockhart on the subject of his name.
As for avoiding him in the corridors...
Let's just say that Vlad could have been a hide-and-seek champion.
As soon as he saw blond hair or a blinding smile, he ran in the opposite direction, all his friends helping him in that endeavour.

Either that, or the dumbass that played Professors would have been massacered already, and it was especially true on that day.

Sighing, Vlad settled slowly next to evin, who activated the spell with a flick of his wand, whispering the incantation.
Thank Merlin Lockhart had chosed to never reproduce the catastrophy that happened with the Gryffindors, and did not brind any more creature in his class.
That, however, made the lectures very theoretical and utterly boring.
Next to him, Kevin sighed and got the previous Defence book, the one that was asked for second-years before Lockahrt required his entire bibliography.

Vlad, quite unmotivated, closed his eye and layed down on the table.
He forced himself to think about anything other than Voldemort and Lady Malfoy, and he thnkafully had the opportunity to.
He had a mission for the Mirage Court.

A month had passed since the start of the year.
A month during which his friends had taken the time to accept his reality.
Not that they did not accept it when they had discovered the Mirage Court, but they had to take some time to understand all the implications.
Being a member of the Mirage Court came with duties, even at their young age.
Neville and Vladmir were active members, they thus had missions and had to follow some hierarchy...
However, when they were at school, work was rare.

Except when it came to Hogwarts.

And that morning, Vladmir and Neville both received a mission order.
If the _Underground_ was officially dissolved, the former members were reassigned to other Courts.
Augusta Longbottom had chosen the _Cour des Miracles_, the French branch of the Court.
Presumably, Neville had received an order to support Vladmir.
He was not a Politician, at least in the Court, and he was to stay in Vladmir's shadow as his right-hand-man, being his assistant in the creation of the future network.

The two members were not idiots.
This mission statement only meant one thing.
The early stages of the revival of the _Underground_, supported by the other Courts.
Other people were probably charged with contacting former members, while they looked for new prospective members in school.
And it implied the creation of an intelligence network in Hogwarts, right under the noses of the Professors.
And it suited Vlad just fine, following Dobby's revelations.
Once the network would be created, any unusual fact would be detected.

To Vlad and Neveille's surprise, Hermione, Kevin and Draco had immediately opted to give them help, unknowingly forming the start of the network in Hogwarts.
They had met in the Alliance's room, and the two boys had explained their mission orders.

"I don't understand," Hermione had said.
"If this network aims to start a new _Underground_, why wouldn't Neville lead it?"

"Because I am not a leader in the Mirage Court hierarchy.
Vlad is a Prince of the Russian Court, a Politician.
He is more able to lead the network than I am.
I am a Mercenary, even if I belong to a Master dynasty.
The aspirations of the Longbottoms, as are mine by the way, are not to be a member of a Triad.
I cannot present as a network leader if I eventually fade into the crowd."

Neville explanations and his refusal to take on the responibility of the entire structure convinced their friends.
They had started to look for potential names and interesting activities, like the smuggling of alcohol, or certains clubs in the school.
Vlad, to their surprise, had chosen to start with the idiot who was their Defence professor.
Lockhart was incompetent in his class and very narcissistic, but he had a talent that was very useful and looked for, that only Vlad knew.

As Lockhart was starting to talk about his favourite subject, himself, Vlad was thinking about how best to use this man.
He already had a good idea, the early stage of which demended that he met him as the end of class, and the outcome was in his pocket.
Vlad was distractedly listening to Lockhart explaining how to managed an Acromentula colony, basing his words on his professional experience.
According to hom, one only had to attract those charming creatures with rabbits and trap them, but Vlad had a different experience with them.
Those giant spiders were immune to most spells and he only knew one efficient solution: running away.

A few minutes before the end, Vlad asked Kevin to cancel his spell.
The young Ravenclaw immediately obeyed, and the professor's gaze immediately went to Vladmir's face, noticing the two scars it harboured, although he was more focused on the one in the form of a lighting bolt.

"Mr Kemenov, please stay!" Lockhart called him out.
Most Ravenclaws and Hufflepuffs gave Vlad a symathetic look while walking briskly to flee the classroom, which made Vlad smile.
Since the beginning, his classmates could see the mediocrity of the teaching, and no girl wanted an autograph any more.

Kevin winked at him and stayed in the classroom, leaning nonchalantly against a wall.
Lockhart, visibly fascinated by Vlad's presence, did not notice that Kevin got his wand out and was starting to play with it, not looking away from the blond man.
He did not notice Kevin casting a Silencing charm on the closed door.
However, the Russian did not miss any gesture from his friend and smiled grimly.
If at the start he had had second thoughts about revealing the underground world of the Mirage Court, his friends adapted remarkably and had adopted the manners of his world.
Although Hermione and Kevin had developped Slytherin-like traits due to their contact with the three heirs, while Draco had already developped them in his family...

"Vlad, Vlad, Vlad..." the man smiled, showing his white teeth.
"Someone as important as yourself should not stay in the shadows!
You have a reputation and a celebrity status to maintain!"

Vlad only raised a mocking eyebrow, which the narcistic man in front of him completely missed.
He did not even seem to ask why he had never noticed Vlad until that day...
Lockhart took his pupil by the shoulders, guiding him to his desk and a tall portrait of himself.

"Look at me, Order of Merlin, and five-times receipient of the Most Charming Smile Award!
This is only a question of publicity.
If you want, my young friend, I can guide you and help you embrace your celebrity, initiate you to interviews, help..."

With a quick gesture, Vlad got out his the man's grip to face him.

"In case you didn't understand, Lockhart, I don't seek celebrity.
And as I had the displeasure to say to a professor before you, we didn't raise hippogriphs together.
I will this ask you to not address me so casually."

"Come on, Vlad..."

Vlad's smile immediately made him shut up.
A cold and sarcastic smile that made the Defence Against the Dark Arts professor step backwards.

"I know who you are, Lockhart.
I know you never did what you claim.
Jeanne Laroche.
Matthew Balcrow.
Achmed Bensaoud...
Do any of those names ring a bell?"

Lockhart had gradually lost his smile as Vlad said the names.
To each of them corresponded one of the acts he had claimed were his own.
With quick gesture, his wand sprang out of his sleeve, but an _expelliarmus_ came from his right.

The professor had a panicked look when he realised that he never noticed Vlad's friend was, which was a source of satisfaction in itself.
Even if Lockhart refused to work with him, Vlad had won this day.
The man that boasted that he was so good at detecting anormal facts and gestures around him never noticed the presence of the young Ravenclaw with an innocent smile who was now playing with two wands.

"Shut you mouth, Lockhart, you're gonna eat Wrackspruts," the falsly innocent Ravenclaw mocked him.
And Gilderoy opened his eyes wide when he noticed that he could not remember this child name, nor that he never saw him during his lectures.

"You... You..."

"We, yes," Vladmir said, amused, as he sat down on the professor's desk.
"I have a deal for you."

"What is it?" the man asked with a feeble voice.

"Your Obliviator services, under oath, against out silence about the source of your... accomplishments."

"How...?"

"How?
Your real name is Marcus O'Balley, Obliviator for the Irish Department of Magical Accidents.
Officially disappeared twelve years ago, you graduated with honours.
You changed your physical appearance and your magical aura with a Dark Magic spell, which allowed you to avoid recognition."

"How..." Lockhart repeated, before growing pale.
"You're with _them_.
You're with the Mirage Court."

Vlad's smile turned carnivorous, as Kevin softly laughed.
Neither of the boys denied his allegations, although Kevin did not strictly belong to the Court.

"He's not as stupid as he look," Kevin mused.

"Well, appearances are deceiving," Vladmir agreed.

They could see Lockhart's train of thought, stopping first on their age, then their smiling face, before going to the young Russian's forehead.
He was visibly hesitated between laughing in their face, or taking them very seriously.

Gilderoy Lockhart, or rather Marcus, had already met young teenagers raised by the Mirage Court in Ireland.
When he had called upon the Irish Court to illegally change names, the one who contacted him was a fifteen-year-old boy.
Even if he faced two twelve-year-old children, he had quickly understood that being young was not synonymous with being weak...
Lockhart definitely lost his smile and became more serious as he realised the significance of Vlad's words.
He was indebted to the Irish Court, and having a debt with them was very bad if its men took a hold of him.
His only relief was that he was in Hogwarts.
The Mirage Court could do nothing in the school premices.

"Apparently you tried to scam the _Chúirt Ríoga_.
You know the price, I presume."

This time, blood fled the Defence Aagainst Dark Arts Professor's face, as he remembered the newpapers talking about the discovery of Gregorovitch's dead body suspended over Gringott's last year.
Slowly, Lockhart wiped the sweat off his face and nodded.

"I... I can pay my debts," he whispered while looking at the two Ravenclaws.

Only their rounded faces allowed him to remember that they were children.
The calculating shine in Vladmir's gaze was scaring him, but strangely was was terrified of the other one.
His light blue eyes were shining with innocence and malice, his smile was playful...
But he was the one playing with two wands, nonchalantly leaning on the wall.
He was the one whose face he did not remember, so much so that he was convinced he never saw him before.
A second-year Ravenclaw...
They were a handful and he had probably been in all classes, and yet!

"How?" Vlad asked, cutting Lockhart's train of thought short with a sneer...
As if...

The young Kemenov's smile widened and the professor swallowed hard.
The kid was reading his mind.

"I..."

"Here is the deal I propose," Vladmir smiled, "under a binding magical contract this time.
Our silence for your talents as both an observer, and an Obliviator."

"But that's..."

"Would you rather we contacted the Irish Court directly?" Kevin asked without looking at him.
The young Muggle-Born was impressed by his friend's Slytherin side, even if he did not show it for now.
Although going to the professor directly like that was pretty Gryffindor of him...
Vladmir had just proposed his silence against his services... without promissing any protection against the Irish Court.
He would simply not talk about Lockhart to his contacts in the _Chúirt Ríoga_.
He was not sure of the significance of the magical contract, but he would have time to ask afterwards.

Vladmir, for his part, was holding back his laughter when he saw that his friend had understood his plan without having been informed first.
Kevin was undeniably a Ravenclaw, his intelligence was definitely dangerous and he had a remarkable adaptibility.

LOckhart did not really have a choice, and he closed his eyes, preparing to take an Unbreakable Vow.
He slowly raised his hand, but Vladmir smiled mockingly.

"Oh not, dear Marcus...
Not an Unbreakble Vo, a _magical contract_."

He took a parchement and scarlet quill from his pocket, and gave them to Lockhart.

"But that's..."

"A Blood Quill.
Don't you know that magical contracts require the blood of the signataries?"

Lockhart feebly nodded before reading the contract.
Although short, it was perfectly detailed.

> Magical contract between Gilderoy Julius Lockhart, né Marcus Garry O'Balley, and Vladmir Vassilievitch Kemenov, né Harry James Potter.
>
> Witness Kevin Warren Entwhistle.
>
> Mister G.J. Lockhart shall:
>
> - Transmit to V.V. Kemenov any abnormality, any information that is primordial to the school's safety and all suspicious behaviour from student or staff in the school premices, during the whole term of his contract as professor.
>
> Answer summons from V.V. Kemenov in any circumstance and as quickly as possible, except in cases of grave physical or moral incapacity.
>
> Keep private the identities of V.V. Kemenov and K.W. Entwhistle and their implication in the Mirage Court, except with the express oral permission of V.V. Kemenov.
>
> Never endanger the life or security of V.V. Kemenov and K.W. Entwhislte, directly or indirectly.
>
> Mister V.V. Kemenov shall
>
> - Keep private the birthname of G.J. Lockhart and his location from the Chúirt Ríoga, Irish branch of the Mirage Court.

"But it's unfair!" Lockhart took offense after reading the single line that described Vladmi's part.

"How much do you value your life?" Kevin asked, after discreetly reeding the contract over the professor's shoulder.

It was enough.
The man took the quill, and quickly signed, yelping with pain when his signature was engraved in his hand.

Vladmir and Kevin signed in turn, and the scroll immediately disappeared, magically sent to the Kemenov vaults in the Russian branch of Gringott's.
Then, taking a vial of potion from his pocket, the Russian boy healed their wounds, before abandonning a devastated professor.

As soon as they got out of the room, Kevin turned to his friend, smiling.

"If he breaks the contract, would he die?"

"He would lose his magic.
However, such as brutal loss would not bode well for his survival, nobody get out unharmed from that."

"Good...
I don't think he realised how much your written words left numerous loopholes in your favour..."

"Which ones?"

"You cannot directly denounce him to the Irish Court...
However, nothing prevents you from talking about him to Katya, who may transmit the information herself.
And I am not cited in your sentence.
_I_ could inform the Court of his name and location.
He was scared and he was right," the Ravenclaw laughed.

"You knwo Kev, I was not the one he was not afriad of."

"Wha?" the respondant elegantly said, stopping in the corridor.

"You terrified him.
He was unable to remember you...
By the way, you didn't give him his wand back."

Kevin took the wand made out of a lighter wood from his own from his pocket, and smiled hile remembering somehting.

"I read an article of the ancient laws...
Every want taken from the hand of its wizard or witch becomes property of the attacker.
I also kind of remember that only the wands of children under 17 have the Trace..."

Vladmir smirked.
His best friend was a shwred genious.
Lockhart could not complain to then, nor to the Headmaster, because the old snooper would ask the reason for his attempted assault.
And he could not talk about it, as per the magical contract.

"Well, congratulations Kev, you've jsut earned a ne wand."

The smal Ravencla put the new wand into the sleeve holster Vlad had offered him, and made his official one disappear in his uniform pocket, like most students did.
At this moment, the bell rang to signal the end of the afternoon break.

"What's up now?"

"Potions."

Kevin grumbled, but let himself be dragged to the dungeons in the castle basement, only to get out two hours later, even more demotivated.
Snape was still not a good teacher, even if he had gotten better since the start of the year, and he had just asked them for a big presentation on the magical properties of ten plants.

The two Ravenclaws were chatting with Terry and Mandy about the homework they had just gotten from the Potions master when Neville, who was waiting for them in the dungeons corridor enthusiastically waved at them to get their attention.

"Hey Longbottom," Terry smiled.
"Hermione's not here?"

The Ravenclaws had gotten used to seeing both lions with Vlad and Kevin, who had be nicknamed the Gemini by their House, due to the bonds they had ressembling the ones between twins.
They had also noticed the regular presence of a Slytherin, Draco Malfoy, prince of the second-years, no less.
Contrary to the other Houses, Ravenclaw accepted this eclectic group relatively well, noting the radical changes, like Neville becoming more self-assured, Draco growing more tolerant, and Hermione and Kevin integrating themselves more to Wizarding customs...

"No, she's helping Ronald with his Transfiguration homework," Neville smiled softly.
"She's too kind with him."

Mandy acquiesced sharply.

"Totally agree!
He spent half of last year calling her a know-it-all, and the other half asking her for help with his classes.
If I were her, Weasley would have taken a slap way earlier!"

Talking about Weasley, come Vlad, you've got to meet the twins!"

"Absolutely not!" Lisa cried out, coming from behind the little group.
The Ravenclaw girl shook her head, miming a false panic while holding Vlad and Kevin back by their arms.
"They must not meet the twins!"

"Why? Fred and George are..."

"I think she's talking about the Ravenclaw twins," Terry said with a laugh.

"You don't have twins in your House," Neville responded, confused, before following the knowing look of the Ravenclaws on Vladmir and Kevin.

"Nooo! You?"

The two of them exchanged amused glaces and shrugged at the same time.

"I have no clue..."

"... what they are talking about."

"No!" Lisa whined while leaning hopelessly on Terry.
"Now the Gemini are finishing each other's sentences.
We're never going to get out of this one!"

Vladmir and Kevin erupted in laughter, quickly followed by their friends and none of them saw the dark shadow approaching them.

"I would like to know what a bunch of Ravenclaws and one Gryffindor are doing still in the dungeons at this hour..."

The terse voice shut them up, and they apologised profusely in front of Snape, who had appeared behind them, before fleeing the dark place.
They did not see Snape's dark, pensive gaze on the little band.

Neville automatically got his two friends towards the Gryffindor common room, explaining to them that they had to meet the Weasley tins for their project.
The two eagles, curious, followed him through half the castle to the lions' tower.
They were slightly out of breath when they reach the portrait of a fat lady who sang horribly out of tune, until Neville whispered the password.

When the portrait pivoted out of the way, leaving room to enter the lions' den, the two Ravenclaws discovered a warm, round room, decorated with the red and gold of their House.
Numerous bean bags were layed down in front of a large chimney and then windows, while several study tables, some of which occupied already, were pushed against the walls.

Fred and George Weasley were standing next to one of them, leaning over their brother and laughed wholeheartedly.
Ronal was sitting in front of a tall pile of parchment, his face entirely red, visibly boiling wiht anger.
It was probably due to the magnificent donkey ears that he had gotten.
The three accomplices walked closer to hear the conversation.

"Comme on Ronny, I am sure...

"... you will be a perfect foal!"

"Shut up Fred!" Ron groaned.

Said Fred put a hand on his heart, hurt by his brother's comment.

"Ronny, come one, I'm Fred. Forge!"

"Indeed, my dear Greg, I am offended that boor can't tell us apart!
And he supposedly is our brother?"

"Just shut up, I'm working!"

"And that is..."

"... a day to remember."

"My dear Hermione, if this absolute moron..."

"... is troubling you..."

"... please call us to the rescue!"

"Yeah, we'll scare him off."

Fred and George ended up on their knees in front of the young girl like two valiant knights who had just proclaimed their love, while Hermione was literally crying with laughter, holding her belly.
Several other lions were laughing wholeheartedly at the twins' antics.

"Let Ronald work some!" another readhead intervened, wearing his Prefect insigna on his robes.
"Oi! what are you two doing in our common room?"

The question immediately brought back the attention of the whole room on the two Ravenclaws lost in a read-and-gold wave, while Hermione waved at them while she wiped the tears from the corner of her eyes.
Neville walked in front of his friends, to most Gryffindors' surprised, as they were used to the shy and clumsy boy.

"I invited them, Percy.
I wanted them to meet Fred and George."

The Prefect dryly nodded and the twins came towards them.

"The infamous Gemini from Ravenclaw," the taller of the two raved as he bowed to the two eagles.

"We are delighted..." Kevin started.

"... to meet the great..."

"Weasley twins!"

Fred had a small tear growing at the corner of his eye when witnessing the perfect coordination of their words, moved to see that they like like his twin brother and him, as VLad and Kevin both smirked.

"And what do you want?"

"We're working on mischief liquorice, or..."

"We want to talk business," the Russian softly whispered so that nobody else heard them, especially not Prefect Percy.

The two twins eyed Neville, who reassured them with a nod, and they brought both of them to their dormitories while continuing the discussion on mischief loqurice.
It was a round room, like the common room, except that this room had a corner.
Out of the seven beds of fourth-year Gryffindors, three were pushed into it.
It as this way that the twins pushed them, and they discovered a camouflage spell protecting their corner.
There was a whole mess: vials of suspicious substances were piled up upon grimoires, and an old cauldron was softly bubbling under the small window, orange smoke escaping through the opening.

"Here, we won't be disturbed to talk.
We have put up privacy spells," one of the read-heads reassured them.
"By the way, since this is the first time we meet: I am Fred, the real one, and this is George."

"Vlamdir and Kevin," Neville rapidly introduced them, even if they knew each other by name.

"So you want to talk business?
Who gave you our names?"

"Yes, business talk, and Slytherins talk, you just have to listen," Vlad smiled, while the twins stayed serious in front of him, which was pretty rare.
"I know you lead the school's smuggling network, and I come to propose a partneship."

"What kind?" Fred asked, suspicious.

"I am able to procure alcohol, tobacco and potions at market price.
I don't do drugs, however."

"I have a hard time believing you," George said slowly.
"No vendor would accept selling at standard price to a minor."

"No _official_ vendor," Vladmlir smiled again.

"Assume we accept," George slowly declared after looking at his twin, both intrigued by his offer.
"What would we gain, us as well as you?"

"Lots of money...
I know you sell the low-grade Fire-Whiskey at 20 Sickles a litre."

The twins nodded, as it was the price they practices.
As for Vlad's question on their buy-in price, they told him it was 15 Sickles, far from the usual 8 of Wizarding shops."

"The litre is available at 5 Sickles with professional wholesalers, not taking Knuts into account.
I can have it for that price, plus 10% for transport.
With the same price, you'd pocket 15 Sickles.
In case we have a agreement, I would ask you 33% of the profit, since we would be three associates, which would be 5 Sickles.
You gain 10 Sickles per litre instead of 5 Currently.
And it's only _one_ example."

"What would would you be able to procure us?" Fred asked with unfeigned curiosity.

"I said it already: nearly everything, including potion ingredients that are illegal in England, but legal in Russia for your little experiments.
Everything except for drugs, whatever those are."

"And apart from the financial part, what do you want?"

Vladmir looked at the twin who just talked.
They were not stupid, and they knew perfectly well that Vladmir was looking for something behind it all.

"I am looking for two things, George.
Your information about gossip, as well as all intelligence you have on staff, students, parents, everyone.
And..."

"And?"

"Your talents as potions-makers."

Afterards, Vlad, sitting at the Ravenclaw table, was more than satisfied with his day.
He knew the name of the person responsible for the future troubles in the school, he had built the start of the Hogwarts network, and he had put his hands into the smuggling system of the castle when the Weasley twins had accepted their partnership.

He was thus chatting calmly with Luna about the new Quibbler article while finishing his molasses pie.
Vlad was nonetheless relularly looking at Draco.
The Slytherin, while surrounded by his friends, as still paler than usual, which worried Vlad.
He was going to stand up and walk to him, when Albus Dumbledore's voice rang abover the general noise of the Great Hall.

"Children, calm down please, it seems we have visitors!"

All turned to the Great Hall door, where four men were standing, straight and proud, including one Russian Auror, and one English one, with his characteristic red robes.
Vlad paled before taking a glacial face.
What was Karzkern doing here?

The young Russian stood up, furious that the firbord dared taking his Clan's business in the school.
He could see Dumbledore's gaze stop on the mercenary insigna on engraved on the leather chesplate of the magical creature, then on the Russian Auror's sabre.

"What are you doing here, Karzken?" Vladmir coldly asked, his voice echoing in the nearly silent room.

The firborg had a frightening smile, showing teeth that were too pointy to be human, and turned to the professor's table.
He announced with a powerful voice, gloating with satisfaction, why he came.

"In the name of the Fedovir Clan, I, Boris Pietrovitch Karzkern, challenge Vladmir Vassilievitch Kemenov, heir to the Kemenov Clan, Lord Potter, according to the ancient duelling laws of the Russian Empire."
