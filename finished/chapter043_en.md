# Chapter 43: Betrayal

Vladmir sighed deeply and tried to stay silent, although it was not is forté.
When something annoyed him, he tended to say it out loud.

To hear McGo ramble on and on about the dangers of human Transfiguration was not his cup of tea.
Nor his glass of vodka.
And especially not a joy elixir.
How to explain it…
Vlamdir and Transfiguration…
Two opposites…
Two notions that had nothing in commin.
And that was the reason of his desperate sigh.

He had been ruminating a piece of news for the last month.
The one time that he learned something new about his father, something that Katya did not know!
The one it he learned something new about his father, it had to do something with Transfiguration!
James Potter was a bloody _Animagus_!

Kevin sniggered when he saw his best friend let his head fall on his notes, depressed.
He knew exactly what was in his mind, and it amused hil.
Especially when he saw the severe Transfiguration Professor looking at them.
Even if her behaviour had imprived, she could not treat the two students like the others.

"The old hag is looking daggers at you," the Muggle-Born noted calmly.

"Mr. Kemenov!
Listen in class, if you please, or get out!" the Head of Gryffindor sighed.

Vladmir raised an eyebrow, sarcastic, as a mocking rictus formed on Kevin's lips.
She would truly never learn.
The Russian calmly stood up and packed his stuff, astounding the witch, before walking to the door.

"Mr. Kemenov!" Professor McGonagall yelled in horror.
"The Headmistress will be informed of your poor attendance!"

"Inform, inform," Kevin sniggered in a whisper, but the Professor's feline ears heard him.

"Mr. Entwhistle!
Watch your words, or…"

She did not have time to finish that Kevin stood up himself to pack his stuff, making the Ravenclaws laugh and the Slytherins mime in amusement.
Draco, Theo, and Blaise even mimed silent claps behind McGonagall's back.

The door closed on the Gemini as a loud "40 points from Ravenclaw! EACH!" rose up, and the teenagers looked at each other, amused, before running down the stairs towards the greenhouses.

Avoiding the new monitor‑thank Merlin, the Headmistress had fired the horrible Filch and had hired two monitors with a pet falcon and a gamekeeper‑Kevin and Vlamdir squeezed through the school's secret passages to join Neville and Hermione who worked on Herbology homework.

"Hi Mione!" Kevin exclaimed, leaning over a cutting of weeping pea to kiss her cheek.

"Hi Mione!" Vlamdir added, imitating his friend to kiss the girl's other cheek.

She stopped his movement and looked at them suspiciously up and down.

"You should be in Transfiguration.
What did you do to our Head of House to be so joyful and for her to throw you out?"

"Nothing," Kevin smiled innocently.
"Oooh, my cute Sasha!
_Come here, girl, I need to ask you a question!_"

"She did not throw us out, we left before she could," Vlamdir laughed as the small viper, who was basking in the sun with three of her not so small babies, lazily raised he hear at Kevin's call.
She let herself be picked up by a euphoric Ravenclaw.

"Alright guys," Neville sighed, appearing from under a table covered in compost, a vine desperately trying to escape his grasp.
"Are you drunk?"

"No!" Kevin took offence, talking quietly with Sasha and her offspring.

"Are you high?" Hermione tried.
"Alright, forget that!" she added when Vladmir looked daggers at her.

"Drank a euphoria potion?" Neville wondered.

"Taken any illegal substance?" Hermione added, wavering pruning shears under Kevin's nose, who pushed the weapon away from his face.

"No!" the two Ravenclaws repeated in unison.

"What dirty trick have you prepared?" Neville eventually asked, his gaze suspicious.

With spring, both students had become unbearable, and only their excellent academic results made them avoid more serious troubles.
Some poeple found it amusing, including a certain Defence Against the Dark Art Professor, who denied it, and a Potions Professor, who would rather drink a whole bottle of poison rather than admit it.
As for Augusta, she could not be cross with them.

She knew that Keller's dossier had profoundly affected Vlamdir.
The data the _Underground_'s Tracker had gathered were a complement to those the _Sermirrov_'s Tracker had found.

Thus, they had details of the implication of Albus Dumbledore's in the deaths of Cassandra Nott, James and Lily Potter, Damius and Remus Rowle, Eileen Prince, Sarah and John Bones…
All the details had eveidence attached to them.
Memories, incriminating documents…
They could finally piece together an official file, which the Five Families had started a month prior.

Except that the man was still missing.
The Ministry for Magic had not yet declared the former Hogwarts Headmaster a fugivite, but the Royalist Coalition, the name given to the Five Families, along with the pretigious Longbottom, Malfoy, and, more surprisingly, Greengrass lines were pressing the Wizengamot.

It was time that the wizarding wolrd discovered the real objectives of that manipulatiing old man they had admired for decades.

As a result, Vlamdir, on edge and thirsting for revenge, was going round in circles in Hogwarts like a caged hippogriff.

The Alliance did their bast to keep him occupied.
Kevin managed to give him ideas of pranks on Professors and students they did not like, starting from McGonagall.

Luna had made him her Russian teacher, and she was a remarkable student.

Neville, on the contrary, got it into his head to teach Vlamdir Herbology, his second least favourite subject.

The Weasley twins had asked for help to plan their future after the school, something about a jokes and novelties shop on Diagon Alley.

Draco, for his part, had sent him to help Hagrid manage the hippogryphs, especitially since the former gamekeeper was worrying for one of his protegees.
Vlamdir flew often with one of those magical animals, affectionnately named Buck, which relaxed him so much.
And this hippogryph had given him another distraction.
Gregory Goyled had been injured by the magical creature at the start of the year, and Vlamdir was using his network to avoid Hagrid from getting into troubles.

As for Hermion, she was, unconsciously, the one which had distracted Vlamdir the most.
She had asked for his help for research in Runes, as well as Arithmancy.
Which had intrigued the Gemini, who were blocking on the simplest problem.
The Runes and Care for Magical Creature classes were happening at the same time in two opposite sides of the castle.
However, the young girls was in class with them, but also, according to Parvati Patil, the slightly simple and Gryffindor twin to Padma, she was also in class with them.

In short, Hermione's mystery intrigued the Gemini.

"Do I have something on my face?" she eventually asked, frowning.
Kevin smiled in response.

"No, but we have a question for you?"

"Split personnality?"

"I am not schizophrenic!"

"Schizophrenic?" Vlad repeated.

"Muggle illness," Kevin explained breifly.
"No, splitting… like a clone?"

"You probably were drugged without your knowledge," Neville mumbled, puttin a hand on Kevin's forehead.

Kevin distractedly pushed away the hot hand on his forehead, his gaze not leaving Hermione.

"Are you paying someone to take your appearance?" Vlamdir continued.

"What are you on about?" the young girl was horrified.

"Maybe it's one of her licorine's gifts," Kevin declared, putting his head on his joined hands, thinking deeply.

"Merlin's blood, what are you talking about?" Neville was furious, and he looked daggers at the Gemini.

"We're talking about her ability to follow two both the Initiation to Wizarding Culture, Runes, Arithmancy and even Care for Magical Creatures classes without missing a single leson…"

"… thus, her ability to be present for two classes at once," Kevin added.

"So that was the subject of your ultra-secret research?" Hermione stammered.

"Among other things," Kevin sniggered, "but you're still not answering the question!"

"You… you…" the young woman said with difficulty, before blushing under the two Ravenclaws' inquisitive gaze.
"I can't talk about it."

"So, it's illegal?" Vladmir said, amused, taking the same pose as Kevin.

"No!" the young girl protested.
"I have permission form the Mi…"

Hermione immediately fell silent, her eyes wide, knowing she had said too much to the two remarkably intelligent Ravenclaws.
Anxiously, she observed Kevin taking a small piece of parchment out and cross several items off a list.
Neville, curious, leaning over his soulder to read out loud:

"_Duos corpus_…
Polyjuice…
Something in Russian…
_Spriritus possessionem_, isn't that Dark Magic?
huh?
Time Turner…"

"You have a Time Turner?" Vlamdir suddenly whispered, having observed Hermione's expressions carefully.

Hermione tried very hard to not step away at the Russian's dark gaze.

"The Headmistress forbid me from telling you when Pettigrew feld, but I didn't…"

She could not say any more when the Russian lef tthe room in a whirlwind.
The three students looked at each other and ran behind him.
They went past Draco and his Slytherin friends, who looked at them, astounded.
It was quite rare to see the little friend group rushing so much.
The Malfoy Heir swore, feeling trouble brewing.

"Nev…
Nev!
Neville!" Draco yelled

"No time Dray!" Neville answered, stopping for a few seconds before turning the corner.

And Draco saw the worry in the Gryffindor's gaze.
After seeing Vlad and his fury, he now suspected his destination.
The Headmistress's tower.
And it must be serious, if Neville was so afraid for her grandmother.

Vladmir, meanwhile, did not bother to wait for them, and ran straight to the entrance to the Hogwarts' Headmistress's office.
Without any hesitation, he straightened up in front of the impressive stone statue and used his magical heritage.

_"Open for Slytherin's Heir"_ he hissed.

The gargoyle immediately obeyed and Vladmir ran up the stairs, while the guardian statue closed behind him.
His friends swore when they were stuck at the entrance to Augusta's office.

<hr>

The old woman was ready the latest minutes of the meeting with the Board of Governors.
She fumlinated out loud agains the few conservatives who bothered her with the new specializations that were proposed, nearly six months after she took office.
Apparently, some did not like that students learned politics, magical history, or even defence and mediwizardry.
Education had the benefit of dealing children a better hand to understand society and develop a critical mind, which was something some old wizards thirsty for power did not want to see happen.
A wizarding people able to think?
Merlin no!

What bothered Augusta right now, was Donald Verkins's implication.
The Pure-Blood, from a minor family and a Governor, was know in the _Underground_ to not take any decision unless he was paid off.
Someone was throwing a spanner in Hogwarts's works.
But Who?

She vaguely heard someone in the stairs and returned to earth, then frowned.
No one could enter the domain of the school's Headmistress, appart from Minerva McGonagall, as Deputy Headmistress.

When she felt the harsh waves of Dark Magic, she immediately knew who was climbing the stairs.
Only a familiar young Russain could emit such powerful magic waves.
And his status as Heir of Slytherin probably could open him all the doors in the school.
She wondered if she should contact the Kemenov matriarch, but she was not able to move when the door opened violently.

Augusta frowned when she saw Vlamdir Kemenov's completely expressionless face, and his eyes shining glacially.
She should have called Katya…

"You knew!" Vlad whispered.

"What did I know, Vlamdir?" she asked calmly, joining her hands together in front of her.

"Hermione has got a Time Turner, you knew it, and you let Pettigrew flee when he should have been arrested!"

"It's more complicate than that," Augusta tried to temper.

"There is nothing complicated!" Vlamdir declared, slowly raising his voice.
"You could have captured him and you did nothing!"

Augusta shivered at the sudden coldness in her office.
She had heard about Vlamdir's gift.
As any true Mage, he was able to use ambiant magic.
The Russian Mages tended to use ambiant heat to feed their magic, which made temperatures plummet around them.
Their nickname was not only due to them coming from a cold country.

"Your are blinded by your thirst for vengeance, Vladmir," she tried to calm him.
"Pettigrew should not have been killed.
Not before being tried."

"You only needed to tell me!
**Why do you and Katya spend so much time hiding things from me!**" the Russian screamed out, making the old woman flinch.
His voice was starting to break, and his voice was very low, nearly frightening, compared to his still juvenile face.
And if his used Russian, it meant that he was more than furious.

"Would you have let him live?"

"Yes!
I'm not stupid, I kne he needs to be alice to free Siris.
**You betrayed me!**
You all betrayed me!"

Augusta felt a knot form in her throat.
The pressure from Vlamdir's magic was powerful and terifying.
If the Russian did not calm dwn, other professors would feel it.
And apparently, he was not ready for appeasement.
She chose, grudgingly, to use the heavy-handed approach.
As Vladmir continued to tell her about his resentment, she did a small hand gesture.

Vlamdir fell silent immediately, putting a hand on his neck as he felt a sting.
He understood suddenly and opened his eyes wide as he realized that the Headmistress had just injected something into him.
Then his gaze clouded ofer and Augusta Longbottom saw him stagger.
In a small motion, she approached of of the seats, carefully watching the Russian's motions, increasingly hesitant.

She had obviously poorly dosed her poison, since the young Russian was still standing.
She stood up to support hom, but he stepped back towards the chimney, his eyes fully black in anger.
As he leaned on the mantlepiece, the Headmistress saw anger turn into pain in his gaze, revealing another emotion: stupefaction.
She only realized too late the young man's intentions.

In a whisper that did not allow her to hear his destination, Vlamdir disappeared.

<hr>

Sergei was quietly reading an old philosophy treaty in his personal library.
He tried his best to calm himself down.
To meet the Vampire Lord of England had stoked the fire of old rancours between the vampire clas of Europe.
The Russian vampired hated his blond counterpart who reighed over England, and the latter returned the sentiment.
He understood why Augusta had invited him.
Valerius Dominis was a full member of the British Court, but… he would have preferred to know beforehand to prepare for complications between the clans…
And the worse thing was his escort.
The unknown ginger man, and yet, sol familiar…
Not one else seemed to have seen him, however…

A small bell rang in the air, and he frowned.
It announced the arrival of a guest in his drawing room.
Mumbling against impromptu visitors, he stood up from his seat and walked to his chimney.
What he found worried him.

Vlamdir, wearing his Hogwarts robes, was sprawled out on his rug, breathing weakly.
With his vampirinc speed, he flew to his sides and noted with relief that he was still conscious, although his gaze was clouded.

**"Vlamdir Vassilievitch, do you hear me?"**

**"Ser… gei…
Not… Katya…"**

The vampired frowned when he realized that his protégé was still holding his neck.
He softly moved the hand away and saw the miniscule drop of blood.
Sergei had seen this type of small wounds enough.
He had been poisoned.

**"Who?"**

**"Au… gus… ta…"**

Leaning over Vlamdir's neck, Sergei smelled, then carefully licked the scarlet drop, detecting the main components.

**"Improved Draught of Living Death,"** he whispered.
**"You will only sleep.
Stop fighting, Vlad,"** he added, realizing that only his iron will and magic kept the young man still awake, and that this same will was quickly exhausted him.

**"Promise…"**

**"Promise what?"** Sergei worried, as much on the demand as the Kemenov's stubbornness.
He was exhausting his magic by fighting the poison, and he worried about his skin turning cadaveric.

**"Don't… tell… anyone."**

**"No, Vlad, I…"**

Vlad's magic pulsed and Sergei clenched his teeth as he saw the plants starting to wither slowly.
The young man was resisting⋅
Sergei, tetanized, saw Vlad raise up slightly and understood, astonished, that he preferred leaving over staying in a safe place without the promise.
What happened in Hogwarts, by the czars' ghosts?

**"I promise I won't tell anyone until you wake up."**

Thankfulness shone his the emeral eyes before Vladmir stopped struggling agains the poison.

Sergei swore when Vlamdir faited almost immediately.
Worried, he quickly took his pusle, noting the slow but regular beating of his hear, then quickly felt his slight fever.
The improved version of the Draught of Living Dead that Augusta Longbottom, Master Assassin of the _Underground_, was dosed well enough so that he did not die from it, but he suspected that she wanted to put him into a coma.

He softly picked Vlamdir up and hesitated, before goiing to his Lair, whose door instantly opened in front of him.

A vampire's Lair was his secret garden, his living space.
Even if Sergei did not sleep any more because of his vampiric nature, he, like all vampires, went through phases of catatonia, when his brain and senses, stimulated by everything, rested.

The Vampire took the time to observe Vlamdir, who was lying down on his bed.
It had been three years since he had seen him regularly, and his little protégé had changed!
He was not really the small child he knew any more, but was turning into an adolescent.

Brushing the fine scar on his cheekbone, Sergei remembered that it had made him think twice about sneaking out ever again.
Then, he thought about the rest of the scars on his body.

Sergei put a cold hand on Vladmir's torso, remembering the curse that affected hom last year, then the arm, which had been stabbed during the duel with the mercenary during his first year.
Two years, two scars.
This year, however, Sergei was certain that his injuries would be moral…
After he had wounded his godfather, Augusta Longbottom, one of the women Vladmir trusted the most after Katya, had apparently betrayed him.
Because knowing his little protégé, he would take it as a betrayal.
He only needed to know what had provoked him.

Someone knocked discreetly on his door, and he stood up to open to the person at the door, taking care to hide his guest using his body.

**"What do you want, Nikolai?"**

The former Emperor of Russia was worried, the usually pale skin vampired had was now properly cadaveric.

**"I felt Vlamdir's small in your drawing room,"** Nikolai explained, **"and Katya just called to warn that Vlad had fled Hogwarts."**

**"And?"**

**"I told her that he was not here, and that I would tell you when you left your Lair."**

While Nikolai was an ancestor to the Kemenovs, he was also a member of the St-Petersburg Clan, and Sergei's Child.
The latter had transformed him, and Nikolai's allegience was first and foremost to him.
If Sergei had not said anything about the young heir's presence in the clan's palace, it was not his place to do it.

**"You did well."**

**"Is Vlamdir okay?"** Nikolai eventually asked, after a few moments of silence.

**"Poison, only dosed to put him into a deep sleep."**

Nikolai simply nodded, knowing perfectly well that he could never get into his Sire's Lair, before go about his business.

<hr>

Vlamdir woke up three hours later, deathly pale, which worried Sergei.
Th vampire had taken back his book, took some things in the kitchen, then had sat back down to watch him.

**"How are you?"** he asked, handing out on of his favourite cakes.

**"Numb and queasy," Vlad mumbled in a slurred voice, laboriously sitting up.
**"Where…"**

**"My Lair."**

Vladmir opened his eyes wide and looked around him with curiosity, noting the dark walls and the comfortable bed.

**"What happened?"**

**"Longbottom betrayed me, in a way,"** Vlamdir's face clouded over.

Sergei listened to him silently retell his discovery and meeting with Augusta.

Hermione, who had a Time Turner.

Augusta who had lent it to her at the start of the school year so that she could follow all her classes.

And above all, the fact that she had not said anything about using it when Pettigrew fled from under their noses, his flight a matter of barely a quarter of an hour?

**"You know, Vlamdir, even though I reproache Augusta for hiding this detail from you…"**

**"Detail?"** the young man took offence.

**"Yes, detail,"** Sergei continued calmly, looking dagger at him for having interrupted.
**"It is a shame that she did not say anything, but on the other hand, if you had your hand on Peter Pettigrew, would you have let him unharmed?"**

**"Yes, I would have let him live,"** Vlamdir spat out.
**"He betrayed my parents, it's like he cast the spell himself, I would not have only stopped him!"**

**"What about Sirius Black?"**

**"What do you mean, Sirius?"**

**"The only thing that would allow him to get out of illegality, the only thing that would allow him to get back his rights, is Peter's presence.
I know you Vlad, you would have killed him."**

**"What about Veritaserum?"** Vladmir said, not trying to deny the vampire's declaration.

**"You know perfectly well that Veritaserum cannot be used on some people.
Especially Azkaban prisonners, at least not if we want a trial without any possibility of appeal."**

Using a truth serum this powerful on a man this mentally unstable‑because any person spending more than two years in the magical prison developped serious psychological disorders‑could be contested.

Vlamdir scowled.
He agreed with the form, but he was still convinced that they could just have told him before he started to pursue Pettigrew.
Even when he was furious, he still heard constructive remarks.

**"However, I am against the use of poison like Augusta did,"** Sergei continued.

Vlamdir did not answer and fell back down on the pillows.
Katya would give him a huge earbashing, but he was thankful to Sergei for not revealing his presence in the domain of the St-Petersburg vampires' domain.

Sergei, knowing his young protégé's character, let him alone to think and nibble on the biscuits.

Vlamdir spent the whole day on the huge palace that was home to Sergei's clan.
The vampires all knew him, at least from reputation, and they left him alone while he recovered.
He spent most of his time in the library, thinking about many things, especially a particular dossier.

Ever since he had gotten Keller's documents, some particular thing tormented the young Russian.
He made the most of solitude to gather all his knew about his parents' death and Dumbledore's implication in this crime.

The old wizard had eliminated half of the Five Families.
Keller had made an assumption when concluding the reports.
An assumption that was not so wrong.
Only the parents had been targetted initially.
Albus Dumbledore had managed perfectly with Susan's paretns and Severus's mother.
He had done half the work with Theodore's mother, Nott Sr. was miraculously absent that day thanks to an urgent matter in the Wizengamot.
He had completely missed when he only hit the elder Rowle children, but they were not supposed to be part of the trip, according to what Damocles had told him.

And his parents in all this?
It was this detail that tormented him.
Keller's dossier agreed with the one he had gotten in Russia from Jorgl, his Goblin contact.
However, both reports could not clear one question up…
How could he have pointed Voldemort towards his family?
He knew that Peter Pettigrew was the Secret Keeper, since Albus Dumbeldore was the caster.
But how could he have known that Pettigrew was the traitor?
Unless Voldemort and Dumbeldore worked together…
But it was impossible, right?

Vlamdir could not make the information connect.
Most important of all, he missed the reason for the crime.
He agreed that power could do many things, but when Dumbledore had started to kill off their families, they merely kept to themselves, ignoring each other at best, openly hating each other at worst, like the Potters and the Notts.

He missed data.
Too much data…

Vlamdir spent his day ruminating, and when the night fell, Sergei wrested him off his sinister thoughts and accompanied him to Hogwarts.

<hr>

The two men froze in front of the gates.
The Hogwarts domain gate were closed most of the time, contrary to the time when Albus Dumbledore was Headmaster.
Augusta Longbottom had reactivated the old Gamekeeper responsibilities.
Rubeus Hagrid could never have used the Apparition seals for his position, nor used the school's communication magic, but the new gamekeeper could.

However, the gates were guarded.
Sergei clenched his teeth and made Vladmir walk behind him as the young Russian grew significantly pale under the Dementors' influence.
Both Azkaban guardians, immobile, stood on each side of the entrance.
A glacial cold emanated from them and Vlamdir, particularly sensitive to their harmful effect, started to breathe heavily.

It was Sergei who reached out to ring the impresive school's  bell, still keeping Vlamdir behind him as best as possible from the Dementors.

**"I'm staying with you,"** the vampired reassured him, putting a hand on Vlad's shoulder as they waited for the Hogwarts gamekeeper to arrive.

**"Katya will be cross with you,"** the young Russian whispered.

**"I know, but I stand by my acts.
I welcomed you knowing the full consequences, Vlamdir Vassilievitch."**

Indeed, he was not a Kemenov servant, only an ally.
Sergei thus had no report to give to the Kemenov matriarch.
The witch knew it, and could not hold it against him.

A small spark announced the arrival of an unknown person inside the school's domain and the cold produced by the Dementors decreased.
Without the doors opening, a man with skin as dark as night and a keen face walked towards them up to the thick wrought-iron gates.
He was followed by a tamed Hinkypunk and leaned on a walking stick, two crows were perched on each shoulder, including one silvery one.

"You are?"

"In a hurry and tired," Sergei groaned, showing his canines.
"We want to see Headmistress Longbottom.

"The Headmistress has better things to do than deal with a vampire right now," the man declared.

"If you don't declare our presence, I assure you you will be out of a job by the end of the day."

The keeper froze, and carefully observed the vampired and the young man with a tired face and pale skin that he held against him protectively.

"Whom must I announce to the Headmistress?" the man finally asked, getting his wand out to actived the direct channel to the Headmistress.

"Sergei Pokhastovine and Vlamdir Kemenov."

The man talked with a few seconds with the person he called, then he opened the gates with a hand gesture.

"The Headmistress is waiting for you," the Keeper declared.
"I have orders to bring you directly to her office.

"We know the way," Sergei declared, his Russian accent thickened by anticipation.
Without waiting any more, he used the vampiric displacement to bring his protégé in Augusta's office.

As soon as they appeared in the cicular office, the five people in it reacted.

"Vladmir!"

A spell few and Sirius Black was tied to his chair by Severus, who found his attitude slightly too exuberant.

"Blimey, Vlad, what…"

_Bam!_

The slap Katya gave her nephew rang out in the sudden silence, right before he was crushed in a bear hug.

**"Don't do that ever again,"** the Russian witch whispered, before realizing that Vlamdir was tense in her arms.
She looked at him carefully, noting his pale skin, the tiny drops of sweat that shone in his skin, and most of all his green eyes, which had a sickly shine.

"Where have you been?" Augusta asked, stepping towards him.

In a reflex, Vladmir stepped back to avoid any contact, and gave the old witch an expressionless gaze.
Sergei showed his fanges, his true face slowly started to appeared as he grabbed the Russian boy towards him, protecting him.

"It is none of your business, Headmistress."

All wizardsa and witches tensed up.
The vampire had abandonne everything that made him slightly human, his skin was a disturbing translucent white with blue veins fully visible, and he openly threatened Augusta.
Katya frowned as Lucius walked towards her and Severus cast another spell towards Sirius, an unspoken Silencing Charm.

"Augusta…
I suppose you did not tell us everything," the Potions Master said slowly, looking daggers at the Headmistress.

"I think she forgot to say that she poisoned Vladmir," Sergei spat out inhumanly.

Katya sharply pivoted, wand in hand.
The temperature fell several degrees as she stared at her _Underground_ counterpart.

"You did what?" she hissed, her weapon pointed on the Headmistress.

"I had to calm him down before he destroyed the office," the witch defended herself, standing tall and proud, despite the threat.

"He stayed in a coma for three hours!" Sergei yelled.

"You poisoned Vlamdir?" Lucius repeated, incapable of realizing everything, while Severus approached the young Russian to examine him quickly.

"Augusta…"

The Longbottom Matriarch sighed and looked at Vlamdir.
In the heat of the moment, it had seemed like a good idea, but her poison had had quite the effect on the child.
And the way he had stepped away…
He did not trust her any more, evidently;

Sighing once more, she sat down at her desk and looked at the present wizards and witches, Sergei, in a protector stance, as was Lucius, Severus was wary and watchful, Sirius, tied up and offended, if she judged the emotion in his grey eyes and his unsuccessful attempts to express himself correctly.

"He learned that Hermione had a Time-Turner since the beginning of the school year."

"So Pettigrew could have…" Katya started, frowning.

"No, he couldn't.
I did not have time to explain because Vlamdir lost control of his magic: when it happened, during the Hogsmeade weekend, the Time Turner was in the Ministry for its monthly check.
The Unspeakables can confirm that if asked."

"We will continued this later," Katya hissed, still threatening, before turning towards Vlamdir.
"As for you, we need to talk a bit.
**Now!**"

Vladmir simply nodded, and Sergei lightly squeezed his shoulder encouragingly.
Needles to say, the young Russian was given an earful, especially when he refused to say where he was, as did Sergei.
But he eventually learned that Vlamdir had a dealing with Dementors, and a threatening smile stretched her lips.
She had found the perfect punishment, and she calmly declared that he had to master a spell before the end of the school year.
And not any spell

<hr>

"I'm fed up," Vladmir groused a week later, letting himself fall on the bench next to Kevin.

"What's happening?" Padma asked.

"You look knackered," Micheal noted.

"Detention," Vlad mumbled.

"Again?"

Vlamdir looked through Terry and nodded, while Lisa filed his plate.
According to the young Ravenclaw, eating would cheer him up, along with ensuring his health.
Maybe it was the reason that she put only sugar in the middle of the chicken…
In her mind, sugar was the best pick-me-up.

The Russian looked suspisciously at the plate in front of him, then his Housemates, before sighing and eating.
No one in Ravenclaw wanted to upset Lisa Turpin.
Not even the Gemini…

"You were with McGo?" Mandy asked, worried.

"No, Lupin.
He is making be work on a spell at my aunt's instructions," Vlamdir grumbled.

And the spell was impossible to master for him.
The Patronus was a spall that was mainly used by "Light" mages.
And Vladmir's magic was fundamentally black.
As a result, after three detentions, he did not even manage to produce a light mist, to his Professor's great frustration.
And Katya had given him an ultimatum: managing to produce a corporeal Patronus before the end of the school year, or stop flightracing.

_"Sasssha, what are you doing here?"_ Kevin suddenly hissed as discretely as possible as he saw a scaley, silvery tail moving underneath a platter.
Vladmir, who had head the characteristic Parsletongue hiss, loked up and vaguely smile as he ate a piece of chicken sipped in custard.
Sasha was in her place, around his wrist in a bracelet form.
Which of her spawn were strolling in the shool again?

Quickly, the blue-eyed Ravenclaw moved one of the huge salad bowls to hide the small ice viper that had sneaked into the Great Hall.

The snake slithered towards him and calmly wraped around his wrist.
Kevin cerefully looked at the imperceptible white patterns that stood out from the scales.
He had made a mistake.
It was not Sasha, but one of her children.
However, Vlad had declared that her children had left the castle to settle in the Forbidden Forest, right?

_"Who are you?"_

A snore, quite loud for a snake, answered him, making Vlamdir snigger, despite the atrocious plate he was trying to eat.

_"It's Cassson,_" Sasha said, letting the tip of her scaley nose show from under Vlamdir's sleeve.
Some Ravenclaws finally saw the snake, but no one was alarmed.
It was well known among the Ravenclaws taht Vlamdir and Kevin were Parsletongues.
The small ice viper had been strolling in the Common Room for the past two year, even if most students never saw her.

_"Her youngest,_" Vlad added.
_"Quite the lazy one."_

Kevin lifted his wrist to his nose to look at the bracelet and softly pet it.

_"Cassson?"_

Another snore rose up, and Vladmir had to hold back a small laugh.
Until another scaley nose with identical patterns came up.

_"And Casssa, hisss sisssster," Sasha hissed proudly.

Without any hestitation, the second viper slithered towards the free wrist and settled down.
At the same time, Kevin grew pale, softly swearing when he felt two simultaneous pain appear.

"They… bit me?"

**"Fucking idiots,"** Vladmir swore so that only Kevin could understand him.
**"Come, we need to go to the HQ before their venom takes effect."**

**"No, you can't enter the HQ for now,"** Kevin whispered while standing up.

**"Why?"**

**"Surprise,"** Kevin smiled, walking out of the Great Hall.

"Well, surprise or not, you will be in delirium for an hour or so until your body accepts the venom.
So, let's go to the HQ…"

"No," Kevin protested.
"We've worked on it for a while and…"

Kevin fell silent when he stumbled and Kevin had to support him as they finally went to the corridor leading to the Ravenclaw tower.

"Why did they…"

_"You are their wizzard," Sasha hissed, not letting Kevin finish his sentence.
_"They chose you."_

"Familiar?" Kevin whispered, as Vlamdir opened the door to the Common Room and guided him towards their room.

"Exactly.
Now, lie down and sleep," Vlamdir groaned, pushing him towards his bed.

"Why is it always happening to me?" Kevin moaned in a weak voice.
"First Knight-Mage…
Now…"

The young Russian watched his friend, pale as death, faint a few seconds afterwards and realised that it was his turn to watch over a sick friend.

Kevin was his best friend, but when he had met him, he never imagined that he would become a wizard so… charismatic and dangerous.
Kevin was not as powerful as Hermione, or even Neville.
He was an averagely powerful wizard.
But he was one of the most intelligent and open-minded people he knew, with an incredible ability to adapt.
Instead of screaming after his new vipers had bit him, he had immediately understood the implications.
By biting him, the two little vipers were linking themselves to him for the rest of their lives…

In the meantime…
What surprise was Kevin talking about?
Was it the reason why no one could go to the Chamber of Secrets?

<hr>

The Alliance was only allowed back in the HQ the next week.
Sasssly was waiting for them, the three ice vipers calmly coiled on the Basilisk.

"Look, we're done with your surprise," Kevin joked, pointing to a huge wall of the Alliance HQ that was covered with an enormous sheet.


"I think you will like like," André said, amused, sitting on the Russian's head.
"I have to admit our two little geniuses have done a tremendous work!"

"What about us?"

"We also…"

"Participated!" the twins exclaimed.

"To say the truth, we could built the prototype thanks to them," Hermione laughed.

"It's just wonderfully done," André declared, a smile in his voice.

"What is it?" Cedric finally asked, looking at the tapestry, curious.

"Go on," Hermione encouraged the Russian by pushing him towards the wall.

Vlamdir looked at everyone.
The four people in the know were confident and smiling.
The other were curious, even Severus, although he his behind his homework markings in a corner of Slytherin's library.

Eventually, he approached and softly pulled on the sheet, which fell down an revaled an incredible surprise.
He looked, speechless, at the impressive work.
It was a marvel of magical genius.
Pure art.
Nevile, Draco and Cedric were staring at the result of two months of relentless work, and even Severus was speechless.

On a full wall of the Alliance Headquarters, Kevin and Hermione had reproduced the Marauders Map in every single detail, up to Hogsmeade, but even more detailed.
Every single space in the school appeared thanks to the plans found in the Chamber of Secrets library.
New secret passageways appeared, the tiniest Slytherin tunnels were revealed in front of their eyes.

The nameplates, calligraphied in Kevin's perfect handwriting, were slowly moving, following the people.
The passwords were visible in another handwriting and gave them access to the whole castle, even the Professors' appartments.

"Morgan," Draco whispered after a while.
"How did you do this…"

"Magic?" Hermione laughed softly.
"We just got the Founders' plans and used the register of students and staff."

"How did you have access to…
André."

Severus looked at the Sorting Hat, who straightened up proudly, happy to have been able to modestly contribute to the project by stealing the staff grimoire in the Headmistress's office.

Fawkes chirped happily while landing on Hermione's shoulder, asking for pets from the Licorine, who gladly obeyed.

The other members smiled.
It was true that the Phoenix rarely appeared, preferring to stay in the Headmistress's office.
The Hufflepuff had never seen him.
Quickly Draco told hom that the Phoenix was not linked with Dumbledore at all.
The legendary bird was awaiting his true Master.

"So why did he stay with Dumbledore?" Cedric wondered.

"Phoenixes have sort of prophetic dreams.
Fawkes knew that he should be in Hogwarts, but not when he will meet his wizard," André explained while grumbling.

The phoenix had thus waited in the Headmaster's office, and Dumbledore had made the most of the situation, declaring him to be his.
Fawkes had let him say it, to the Sorting Hat's great irritation.

"Vlamdir… What is that?" Severus groaned suddenly, his eyes still on the map, fascinated by his observation of the premises.

The young Russian squinted his eyes.
There, at the edge of a map, three familiar names were visible.
Remus Lupin.
Sirius Black…

And Peter Pettigrew.
