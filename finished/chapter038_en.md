# Chapter 38: Presenting Apologies

Life in Hogwarts followed its course, punctuated by classes, research groups and the Alliance little traffics.
The only dark point of the small group was Vladmir...
To say that the Ravenclaw felt downhearted was an understatement.

Vlamdir Vassilievitch Kemenov felt guilty because, as any Mirage, he had some kind of ethics.
Don't hurt innocent people.
Admitedly, anyone could become a source of blackmail to pressure some people, but they were not hurt, despite the threats.
It was the one universal rule shared by all Mirage Courts in the world.
The rule that had protected the underground world of the Magical mafia for so long.

And Vlamdir had broken that rule...
He was thus completely down, and others cood feel it.

A few days after the news of Sirius Black's innocence, as Vlad was growing increasingly depressed, Ravenclaws and Slytherins finally had the long-awaited Defence Against the Dark Arts class.
Gryffindors and Hufflepuffs had told their day with the Boggart, and they had awaited this lecture.

All the Houses admitted one thing: Professor Lupin was the best Professor they ever had for... at least seven years, according to the last-year students.
Even Slytherins agreed, although they officially maintained a haughty and contemptuous façade in front of him.
A man representing authority should respect some dress code, according to both Draco and his godfather and Potions Professor, and Remus Lupin, with his patched-up robes and sickly complexion, did not follow the Slytherins' standards.

The Defence Against the Dark Arts lesson was as awesome as the other Houses had said.
During the two hours, everyone laughed out loud.
It started with the declaration of the announcement of the formula _Ridikulus_, or how to change your fear into a source of laughter.
Good humour was spoiled only by fearful screams, when students went before the Boggart one after the other.

However, while most students thought the class was a game, some carefully observed the students' fears.
After all, it could be useful to manipulate them, but also reveal snippets from their past.
Kevin, calmly staying in the back of the room, did not miss a thing from the revealed information.

Thus, Draco was scared of clowns, an unfortunate experience during one of his rare escapades, while Theodore was terrified of brutal explosions.
Kevin, intrigued, promised to go more in depth into it, because is was a strange fear, surely coming from a bad memory...

The line continued, when a certain Slytherin student's turn came.
Kevin held back a mocking laugh, while Draco gave him a knowing smile.
Pansy Parkinson's greatest fear was... himself!

The Boggart had indeed taken the form of a terrifying shadow that whispered rather degrading things to the young woman.
Sobbing, Pansy could not defend herself from the creature, making Draco and his friends mock here.
Apparently, even Slytherins did not like the young Parkinson.
The only negative point was the dark look from Professor Lupin, who asked Pansy to stay back after the class.

Kevin, however, lost all will to laugh when he was confronted to his own fear.
Like Hermione, he never had true friends, and his own family avoided him...
So seeing his friends turn their backs to him froze him in place...
Until he looked at Draco and Vladmir.

Breathing deeply, Kevin smiled sightly and straightened up, staring at the false Draco, Neville, Hermione, and Vlamdir.

"They would never turn away from me," he declared, confident.

The Boggart shook slightly, but Draco's face has a mocking rictus, while Hermione simply walked away from him.

"I would never break our friendship," the real Malfoy heir declared, putting a hand on Kevin's shoulder.
It was out of the question for the Slytherin that his friend feared their rejection...

The Boggart shook again, and his appearance switched back and forth between the clown and Kevin's friends, before only keeping Vladmir's appearance.

"I would never turn my back on you, Kev," Vlamdir added.
"And I know it's also Neville's and Hermione's case...
You know what we are, and Alliance like ours cannot be broken."

Vladmir's words were fully realised in Kevin's ears.
They were united by links that were stronger's than just friends.
They were a big family, united against all odds.

The Boggart, disturbed, switched to Vlad, then suddenly started to change, as it let its own fear buried into itself.
A ferrous smell diffused into the air.
The smell of blood...
BUt before the Russian had time to raise his wand and the Boggart had time to take the appearance of his greatest fear, some one interfered.

"Here!"

The false Vlamdir focused on Professor Lupin, and it transformed quickly into a silvery sphere, floating a few centimetres from his thin face.

The Russian, already silent and sullen since he learned that Sirius was innocent, looked at the Professor with anger.
Totally oblivious of Vlamdir looking daggers at him, Lupin cast the spell, and the moon became a balloon which loudly deflated.

"Come on Mr. Malfoy, finish it off!"

Draco, worried, looked at Kevin and walked towards the laughing clown.
Kevin saw Vladmir leave the classroom silently and swore silently, hoping the class would end quickly.

The bell rang a few minutes afterwards, and the Ravenclaw was the first one to leave the room, looking for his friend.
He evetually found Vlamdir in the study room of their Common Room, working on his Transfiguration homework.
Despite all his efforts, Kevin never managed to make him unclench his teeth, and he gave up.
Kemenovs are stubborn, and Vlamdir could be a real iron wall when he did not want to talk...

Kevin then got his stuff out and started to work on his own homework.
He would leave him alone in this angry and painful state.
And apparently, he was not the only one, when Luna joined them.
Kevin looked at her briefly squeezing the Russian's arm in a comforting gesture, before settling next to them silently.

<hr>

The next morning, Vlad still was as angry, and his best friend was forced to intervene.
Kevin gave Neville and Hermione a note before breakfast, surprised to see her in the same state of minds as the Russian.
He could feel Dark magic waves irradiating from Hermione's body.
She was furious, aggressively chewing on a poor piece of toast, reading the Daily Prophet.

"Argument with Ron," Neville explained as Kevin asked.
"Crookshanks tried to eat his rat."

"He's a Kneazle, isn't that expected?"

"Appartenly Ronal has a hard time understanding!
How is Vlad?"

Neville looked at the Russian while asking, alone at the Ravenclaw table, ruminating thoughts with a dark expression on his face.

"It's not getting better.
He took took the fact that Lupin prevented him from facing the Boggart very badly.
His pride took a hit."

"He was born to fight and lead," Neville sighed.
"He..."

"Hey guys, did you read the news?"

Hermione pointed the Daily Prophet, slightly pale.
Neville shook his head and took the journal.
He frowned when he looked at the headline.

> Dangerous murderer Sirius Black armed!
>
> Late yesterday evening, Sirius Black was once again seen in Scotland.
> After Hogsmeade, he was seen in St-Dewl, small wizarding village in the Highlands.
>
> Black was pursued by two masked assailants, a violent trade of spells happened between them, alerting the neighbours.
> Despite the Aurors quickly arriving, Black and his opponents had already disappeared.
>
> According to witnesses, Black seems gravely injured and armed with a wand and a dagger.
>
> In order to get further information, the Ministry for Magic looks for the two assailants.
> Both around 1.80m tall, the only remarkable sign was a dark cape with a pattern on the back.
> If...

Nevile rose his head to look at Vladmir.
The Russian had his eyes frozen on the paper, and he looked back at Neville.
What Neville made him extremely uneasy.
The young Russian's eyes fully lacked any expression.
He had already seen this lack of spark...
It was the same look Vlad had when Natashka died.
The same look he had when he entered the duelling arena.

"I will see Professor Flitwick," Kevin whispered.
"And I think we'll need to alert Katya."

"Meeting at noon," Neville added, brushing his enchanted Galleon.

<hr>

That is how, only a few hours later, all the Aliance met in the Chamber of Secrets to debate the Kemenov case.
But one guest had joined the conversation, and incredulously looked at Slytherin's Basilisk calmly coiled on itself in a corner of the room, hissing in its sleep.

"Excuse me Professor, but... why are you here?"
Cedric asked, looking at Filius Flitwick, calmly sitting down next to Luna.
The Hufflepuff's unease was evident.
To know that a Professor supported the contraband in the school was already shocking, but to know that Severus Prince was not the only one was even more traumatising.

The small Goblin smiled while raising his sleeve, showing the Underground's tatoo.

"I am an Underground veteran, and I am one of the first ones back once it formed again recently..."

Severus had said nothing, but his eyes sparkled with amusement.
To say that Filius was shocked to know Severus's new status in the Mirage Court was an understatement.
He had nearly fallen off his chair when he had met the three Triads.

"How is Vladmir?" André asked, appearing on Luna's lap, who tenderly hugged him.

"He's quite scary looking," Neville sighed.

"Scary?" Cedric noted.
"He's terrifying!
Blimey, no Hufflepuff dares walk within two metres of him with his sinister mood!
He has the same effect as the Dementors!"

"That might be a bit much, Diggory" Severus said, calling his House Elf.
A small creature appeared, holding a platter covered with sweets and an enormous teapot.
She served everyone before  disappearing in a silent pop, while Severus put a few drops of a relaxing potion he brewed in each cup.

"No, he's not exagerating," Kevin sighed, handing out the cups.
"He looks daggers at everyone, and is hypersensitive at the moment.
I thought he would curse Lupin yesterday.
Having injured an innocent eats away at him, especially since it's a member of his family."

"He wears his war mask.
He is conflicted," Filius softly explained.
"I would bet that having left Sirius in Azkaban for twelve years also plays a role in his state."

"He should not feel guilty for this," Hermione remarked.

"Indeed, but it would not be surprising that he regrets it anyway."

Severus Prince sighed and softly explained to them the universal rule of the Mirage Courts.
Protecting the innocents was something the magical mafia was uncompromising about.
That his own godfather, especially a former member of the Courts coming from an old Master line, was unjustly injured probably ate away at him.

"I went to see him last night, but he has bottled his feelings in his mind's secret room again," André declared, making the Protions Master make a face.
He perfectly remembered the last time, and he did not want to go back into Vladmir's memories.
Closets in the Ravenclaw's mind were closed for a reason.

"He did not say a word since yesterday," Kevin added.

"Do you know if Katya told him they were actively tracking Black?"

At everyone's surprise, he understood that she did not.
However, the Underground Triad had made finding Sirius Black top priority.
He understood the Russian's sudden change at breakfast better.
To learn from the national rag that the Underground was tracking his godfather probably was shocking for a Russian Court's Prince.
His position should have ensured he had this kind of information.

"The only good thing," Draco said, "is that we know Black is alive."

"I will enquire about Black's state," Severus sighed, standing up.
"I will keep you posted.
By the way, Miss Lovegood, I heard a strange rumour...
Do you and Peeves have a pact?"

Severus held back a laugh at seeing the Weasley twins smile.
Peeves was one of the accomplices for their numerous pranks, although his implication was a closely guarded secret.
Luna stopped reading the Quibbler, had a warm smile, and nodded.

"He's fluttering in the castle's nooks."

"Interessting.
Did he show you new secret passages?"

"Hogsmeade."

"We know it!" the Weasley twins said in unison.

Severus smiled.
Of course they knew it, that was where the contraband transited.
The only thing to know what other tunnels they had discovered...

After he ensured they all drank their tea, the Potions Professor advised them to go to their classes and disappeared in his usual cape twirl.
He had to see Lucius, and especially Katya.

"Well...
Now what?" Kevin asked, grabbing his things.

"Now...
Mugle Civilization class," Draco grumbled.

"What are you studying?" Hermione asked, standing up.

"Electricity," Fred sighed.

"Dad is crazy since he learned what's in the new class," George added.
"He even thinks about enrolling as an unregistered student.
Do you believe it?"

"Even though I am not a Muggle admirer, it's fascinating to see how they alleviated the lack of magic," Draco admitted, walking towards the entrance of the Chamber of Secrets, stepping over a giant snake tail.

"The coast is clear," the magical door declared.

Kavin pet Sasssly's side before calmly leaving.
They had missed lunch, but their friend was more important than any lunch in the Great Hall, whatever the other students said.

The third years split up from the other Alliance members, as each went to their class.
After climbing up the huge magical stairs, they found Vladmir while turning a corner, and he joined them silently.

"So, you talked about me?" he asked with a lifeless voice after a few minutes of walking.

Hermione slightly blushed, then sighed, resigned.

"We're worried about you, Vlad."

"I'll be alright once I have Black in front of me, living so that I can apologise to him."

"They are looking for him," Neville told him.

"I know since I read the Prophet, and I suspected it.
I would have liked to be told, especially since I had Black's blood in a vial, which could help them."

"You are crossed with them because you'd like to be with them to find him," Hermione realized.

Vlamdir pinched his lips, but did not answer.

"Young people, the classes will start soon, and you know we will not tolerate you being late..."

The five students turned towards Professors Tonks, Selwyn, and Lupin, who apparently came from the Great Hall.
They had not realized that they had stopped in the middle of a corridor.

"Miss Granger, have you gotten time enough to prepare your exposé?" Selwyn asked.

"I have, sir," Hermione smiled.

"You have Wizarding Civilization Initiation class?" Professor Lupin was astonished.

"Indeed sir, I am a Muggle-Born, as is Kevin."

"But..."

"Those are the ones I told you about, Remus," Selwyn said, smiling at Vlamdir reaching out towards Neville.
The Gryffindor sighed as he put a few Galleons in the Russian's palm.

"But..." Lupin repeated.

"What?
Surprised that Pure-Bloods can associate with Mudbloods?" Vladmir groaned, putting the money into his pocket.

"Vlad!" Hermione yelled out, outraged, while Draco and Neville looked at him, astounded and disapproving.

"What?" her friend continued aggressively.
"He judged us in a few minutes in the train, not knowing anything about us."

**"Vlamdir Vassilievitch..."** Kevin whispered.
**"Keep your rank."**

**"To hell with him!"** Vladmir spat out.

"Mister Kemenov, you have detention with me tonight at 6pm," Professor Lupin calmly declared.
"I dare hope never to hear such language coming from you again."

Vlamdir simply nodded curtly and left towards the Muggle Civilization Initiation classroom, surprising everyone.
His classmates quickly caught back with him.

"When did you learn Russian?" Hermione whispered, going in the opposite direction with Kevin, Professor Selwyn following more slowly.

"I found a spell for language learning in the Library.
I could deepen my knowledge of Parsletongue with Sasssly's help, and I mastered Russian.
Quite useful, as we spend a lot of time with Vlad."

"What spell?" Hermione asked with marvel in her eyes.

"I'll show you later," Kevin laughed.

<hr>

"Vlad, keep your rank," Neville whispered at the same time when they sat down in front of their Muggle tables, repeating without knowing it the same words as Kevin a few minutes earlier.
Vlad simply sniffed aggressively in response.
He did not particularly want to keep the clean façade of a Pure-Blood heir for now.

Ignoring his state of mind, Professor Tonks took the register quickly, then smiled at them.

"As you can see, after two weeks showing you the importance of electricity and its many uses, we will now study the Muggle transportation systems.
Us wizard and witches mainly use Apparition.
It represents 67% of our travels, followed by the Floo network at 25%, when distances become too large, or to bypass anti-Apparition zones like the Ministry for Magic.
The remaining 8% are mainly brooms and carpets.
Muggles can't travel like us.
They thus had to find alternative techniques based on scientific rules, and physics in particular.
I will show you the main 5 types of Muggle transportation.
Can someone give me an example?
Mr. Malfoy?" Andromeda Tonks called, slightly surprised to see her nephew raise his hand.

"Cars."

"Exactly.
It is the main mode of transport.
How much of trips do you think are made using cars?"

"80%," the Malfoy heir guessed.

"Slightly less.
Road transport represent 75% of travel.
It includes individual cars, coaches, truks..."

While citing the names, Professor Tonks was showing them the different types of vehicles with a projector and children's toys.

"Another example?
Miss Abbot?"

"The train", the Hufflepuff declared.

"Indeed.
THe Hogwarts Express is an example, although it runs on coal.
Nowadays, locomotives are mainly running on fuel or electricity.
Next?
Yes, Miss Patil?"

"The... The blane?" the Ravenclaw declared.

"The plane," Professor Tonks corrected.
"Mr. Kemenov, if my class is not up to your taste, you know what do do!"

Vlamdir, who was looking out the window, lost in thought, slowly turned his head towards the Professor of Intiation to Muggle Civilization.
Andromeda Tonks and Sirius Black looked so alike that it almost caused him whiplash as he remembered they were cousins, and he slolwy stood up, putting his bag on his shoulder.

"Mister Kemenov, what do you think you are doing?" the Professor asked with a glacial voice.

"I am leaving your class, Madam," Vladmir declared calmly, walking towards the door.
He saw a spell fly past him, and deactivated the locking charm on the door with a simple hand gesture.

He barely heard the points deducted from Ravenclaw and seeked refuged at the top of the Astronomy Tower to be alone.

Despite the cold in this late September day, he was feeling hot and was angry...
Vlamdir thus took off his school robes, and loosened his tie, sitting down on the tower's fortifications.

Lost in thought again, he looked at the wind blowing over the centenarian oaks of the Forbidden Forest.
The first colours of autumn were appearing...
This sight appeased him, and he could realize what he had done.

He knew he had acted on an impule.
He never should have talked to Lupin that way.
The Professor deserved better, as did Professor Tonks...
He had apologies to give...
And his friends...
His friends had discreetly supported him...
They too would have to receive an apology.

He did not know how long he stayed there, until he felt something behind him.

"What his happening Vladmir?" a soft voice asked.
"It's not like you to leave a class or talk back to a Professor..."

Vlamdir turned his head towards the new Hogwarts Headmistress.
Augusta sat down next to him, legs dangling negligeantly.

"WHo did you know I was here?"

"Headmasters have access to some ressources to look over such a large school," the Longbottom matriarch smiled.

"The portraits?"

"Among other things," the old woman eluded.
"So, what is going on?"

"I...
I'd like to help find Black," the Russian whispered.

"No."

The voice was soft, but firm.
Augusta looked at him seriously, knowing perfectly well that the teen's dearest wish was to meet Black again.
Fortunately, his motivation had changed.

"We know Sirius wants to see you.
By staying here, it is likely he will try to join you one way or another."

"I..."

"You will apologize to him when we find him.
In the meantime, you have a detention in less than a quarter of an hour, young man.
Professor Tonks also gave one to you tomorrow evening."

"What about the Hogsmeade weekend?
Katya..."

"I told Katya about your troubles.
She did not want to punish you further.
You can go this weekend."

"I am sorry..."

"You should tell other people, Vlamdir.
But you know that," Augusta softly declared.
"Now, go join Professor Lupin before you are late."

Vladmir slowly stood up and took his robes, before helping the Headmistress to stand up.

"Thank you, I am not as young as I used to be."

Vladmir simply smile slightly, before slowly descending the stairs of the Astronomy Tower, while Augusta's gaze followed him.
He walked the maze of corridors towards Lupin's domain, and eventually stopped in front of the door to the Defence Against the Dark Arts Professor's office.

He breathed in slowly and knocked.

"Come in!
Ah, Mr. Kemenov, come on in!"

Remus Lupin was sitting down at his desk, behind an impressive pile of papers.
Vlamdir slowly entered, discreetly observing the office.
Dozens of shelves full of books covered the walls.
Some magical objects were also visible, in a strange organized mess.
He recognised a Foe-Glass, a desk Sneakoscope, and a Dark Magic antenna...
It was a change from Lockhart's office, all narcisistic and flashy ostentatious luxury.

"Sit down," the man sighed, pulling him from his contemplation.

Vlamdir pinched his lips and sat down in front of the man's ofice, in a comfortable seat that had just appeared.

"Before all else, Professor, I want to apologise for my behaviour this afternoon," the Ravenclaw said softly, sitting up straight in his seat.

Remus Lupin looked at him thoughtfully, and Vlad thought once again that the amber colour of his eyes was surprising.
He could almost feel an... animalistic note behind them.
The exact nature of the professor slowly took shape in his mind.

"Apologies acepted.
The Headmistress told us at the start of the week that you were traversing a rough patch, although she did not tell us why exactly.
Her own words were that you would probably develop a reserved behaviour, but with heightened sensitivity..."

"What do I need to do?" Vlamdir asked, after a few moments of an awkward silence.
"For me detention," he added, seeing Lupin's questionning look.

"Do you want a cup of tea?"

Vlamdir, surprised, simply nodded.
Professor Lupin waved his wand and cleaned some space on his desk, before making a tea set appear.

"It is a bergamot orange tea," Lupin declared, giving him a cup.

Vladmir took it and smelled the perfume, remembering evenings with Katya in the Kemenov Palace library.
Bergamot tea was his aunt's favourite.
Did the professor know?"

"Thank you.
But..."

"I will not make you write lines, nor clean cauldrons.
I just want to talk with you?"

"Talk about what?"

"Whatever you want."

Whatever he wanted?
Vladmir thought about his interrogations about the man's amber eyes, the animalistic spark, his reaction to Hermione, the sniffing, the Boggart...

"Are you a werewolf?"

Lupin nearly spat his tea and delicately dabbed his lips with a handkerchief.
Vlamdir admired his mastering, surprising if he guessed right.
Especially so close to the full moon.

"Indeed.
How did you guess?
Your aunt?" the Defence Professor guessed.

"No, sir."

"I would have thought she would have told you about that," Lupin ventured.

"She indeed told me many things on my family and my parents' student years at Hogwarts.
I know you were one of my father's best friends.
That you and my mother were Prefects.
That you were my father's best man at their wedding.
That if I had a younger sibling, you would have been their godfather..."

Lupin seemed surprised and moved by that last information.
Vlamdir smiled slightly.

"But she never told me you were a werewolf," he added.

"Merlin, then how did you guess?" Lupin exclaimed.
"The first full moon has not even arrived yet!"

"Statistically, amber eyes like yours are quite rare, less than 10 percents of the magical population.
Among those, 90% are werewolves.
You also smelled Hermione in the train, a quite canine bahaviour.
And your biggest fear is the full moon..."

"You really are a Ravenclaw," Lupin said with a smile, drinking another gulp of his tea.
"Now, why did you react so... sharply this afternoon?"

"With all due respect, Professor, you judged us in no time at all in the Hogwarts Express.
We all saw your contempt towards Draco, your disappointment at me..."

"You did not correct Mister Malfoy when he had evidently disrespected your friends.
You must know that your mother was Muggle-Born, don't you?"

"He never used insulting words, he only stated a fact.
Hermione and Kevin are exceptions.
They nearly perfectly know etiquette and our traditions.
It is not the case for most Muggle-Born, even those who stay in the magical world."

"So the rumour saying the two students presented at the Saturnalia last year were true?"

"They are.
Why did you not let me face the Boggart?" Vlad asked, suddenly changing topics.

"Well," Lupin said, burrowing his brow, "I supposed it would take Voldermort's face while facing you."

Vladmir raised an eyebrow at the Dark Mage's name, making the Professor embarassed.

"Apparently, I was wrong.
Do you want to face it?"

Lupin pointed to the crate in a corner of the room.
It shook as if the Boggart trapped inside felt their attention, raising a puff of dust.

"Not really.
I think it would take Natashka's or Black's appearance."

"You don't need to fear Black."

"I do not fear Black, I fear for him..."

Lupin frowned and was about to talk, when he was interrupted by a knock on the door.
Severus entered, a fuming cup in hand.

"Mr. Kemenov, I heard of your surprising behaviour...
Lupin..."

"Thank you Severus.
Could you put it on my desk, please?"

Vlamdir forrowed his nose at the sickening smell of the potion Severus had put on the Defence Professor's desk.

"Wolfsbane potion?"

"Indeed," Severus answered, unsurprised by Vladmir's knowledge.
"You should drink it immediately, Lupin."

"I'm doing it," the latter said, turning his words into deeds, grimacing at the taste.

Vladmir, used to the Potions Professor's facial expressions, noted the held back anger in his eyes.
His gaze followed Severus as he left them and asked Lupin the reasons of his anger.

"I am surprised to see him being cordial to you, Vladmir," the man tried to avoid the answering.
"Severus had a grudge against James, and knowing his temper, I would have thought he would hate you."

"Then you do not know him well.
I know Professor Prince is not the type to hate someone for nothing."

Lupin sighed and crosed his hands in front of him, his face growing serious at the bad memory.

"It is linked to a bad joke during our school years.
Do you know Professor S... Prince well?"

Vlmdir smiled as he rose up.

"Have a good night, Professor!"

And the Russian hurried out of the office, leaving the professor surprised, staring at the clock on the wall.
The hour of detention was over, right that second.
And that conversation left him with more question than before.
What did the young Vladmir Kemenov know about Sirius Black?
How did could he have known Severus Prince well enough to detect his very slight expressions?

Remus Lupin sighed.
His instinct was telling him that this year would be eventful.

<hr>

The next morning, Vladmir presented his apologies to his friends for his behaviour, which he also presented Professor Tonks.

"Your apology is accepted, but you still will have detention with me tonight Mister Kemenov," Andromeda Tonks declared severely.
"You bahaviour was unacceptable, especially for an heir of your rank."

Vladmir sighed, silently accepting the remonstrace, before going back to class.
Thus he was at 7pm that same day in front of a computer screen, starnig at the totally opaque surface, along with Draco.

"What have you done to get here?" Vlamdir eventually asked his friend.

"An animated argument with Parkinson.
She is having detention with Sev...
I would have preferred to scrub cauldrons," Draco added, staring anxiously at the strange dark box and its attached pad.

"Come one gentlmen," Professor Tonks laughed.
"It is not that complicated, and count yourselves lucky!
You are the first ones to discover the joy of computers!
Now, take that mouse in your hand!"

Draco and Vlamdir looked at each other desperately, before obeying.
They managed to turn the computer on and use the keyboard and the mouse, before realizing how sadistic Andromeda Tonks nés Black was.

They had to write lines in a text edition software.
'I have to learn how to control my bad temper, I am an educated Pure-Blood,' for Vladmir; and 'I must not insult a girl even if she deserves it, I am a Malfoy by Merlin' for Draco.
Sentences all in biting irony...
Needless to say that in one hour, they eached filled a single page, their professor slightly laughing at them, busy marking their homework.

<hr>

That story was still the talk of the Alliance when they got to Hogsmeade the next week-end.
Vlamdir still was gloomy sometimes, but each time his friends reminded him of the lines on the computer, making him smile again.

When they finally arrived at Hogsmeade after a good half-hour walk from the castle, Hermione and Kevin discovered one of the rare magical villages in Great Britain.
The main street was a busy shopping area, and reminded them of a rural Diagon Alley.
The main street's cobblestones were slightly muddy, and Neville when a chicken had sprung out from under Hermione's nose, making her jump.
That good humour made the last vestige of unease they had all felt passing the castle's gates, guarded by two Dementors.

"That's..." Kevin started, looking at the village.

"Picturesque," Hemione smiled.
"I feel like I'm back in the 18th century!"

"Shall we go shopping?" Cedric asked.

"Didn't you want to go with your friends?" Neville asked, surprised.

"Indeed, hanging out with third and fifth years is bad for your image of Perfect Hufflepuff," Fred laughed.

"I'm avoiding Chang.
She's quite clingy."

"She's shouting from the rooftops that she's gonna be your next girlfriend," George sniggered.

"Her?
Please no!" Cedric was horrified.

"Then who?" Neville teased him.

"Well, I have to admit I have a crush on Eleanora Ogden."

"That's ambitious!
Apparently Lord Ogden closely monitors his daughter's suitors."

"My father is negotiating a marriage contract...
Zonko first?"

The mocking looks Cedric got at his flagrant avoidance made him sigh.
He thus was teased all morning as the first visited Zonko, where the twins stocked up, before joining their friend Lee Jordan.
They then went to a small library, before Cedric left the thrid years when they walked in front of Madam Puddifoot's Tea Shop.
Kevin was the first to notice the pretty Slythrin redhead that awaited him.

"Elanora Ogden," Draco smiled.
"Pure-Bloof from an old Scottish line, her family amassed wealth thanks to the alcohol trade."

"Wait...
ogden, like Ogden's Firewhisky?" Kevin asked.

"Exactly.
She's the youngest.
Her older brother is a billionnaire, and her dot will be... exceptional.
That's why her father pays close attention to her suiters!"

After getting to the Living Magic, a shop specialized in magical plants and animal where Neville, Hermione, and Vladmir found gifts for plants and treats for their respective animals, they eventually settled down at a table in the Three Broomsticks.

The pub, full of students, was warm and welcoming, and they did not wait much for someone to take their order.
After the waiter, a warm lady, went to fetch their five butterbeers, they started an Explosing Snap game.
Vlamdir was skillfully leading the game, when he saw a group of four people stop at the Three Broomsticks' entrance.

"Oh fuck," he swore.

"Vlad!"

It was so rare to hearm him swear that they turned to the source of his surprise.
Lucius Malfoy was standing in the entrance, Katya at her side.
Vlad smiled when he saw how close they were.
They were standing in such a way that their relationship was flagrant even without any inappropriate gesture, and could not help but be happy for her.
Augusta was having a conversation with his aunt, while the Lord talked with his best friend, Severus Prince;

Vlamdir and Neville were the only ones to note the three bodyguards behind them, hiding among the students.
After all, four Triads were in the same place, and that was quite rare...

The four adults approached them, and Katya embraced her nephew, kissing himon his forehead.

**"How are you Kitten?"**

**"Good."**

**"Vlamdir Vassilievitch,"** Katya sighed, sitting down next to him, thanking Kevin who had moved to leave her some space.
Lucius sat down next to her and smiled at his son, while Augusta sat down between her grandson and Kevin.

**"I feel awful, but you already know that..."**

**"I had echoes of your behaviour last week, indeed."**

**"I apologized and..."**

**"You were already punished for that...
I know as well.
I am proud that you took the initative to apologize to your friends and professors."**

Vladmir suddenly relaxed at his aunt's reassuring words, not aware that he was this tense before.
He had unconsciously been afraid to disappoint her, he was relieved to know it was not the case.

"Any news from Black?" Draco asked, sipping on his Butterbeer while Madam Rosmeter, the owner, walked to their table herself to bring tea, two Whiskeys, and the Vodka the adults had ordered.

"Thank you dear," Augusta said with a smile, paying her, before sipping on her tea.

"Indeed.
Black is around Hogsmeade.
Keller's men are on his tracks.
One of Sergei's vampires is helping them..." Severus calmly explained after Madam Rosmerta walked away.

Keller was the new head of mercenaries of the _Underground_, who had lived through the fall of the first British Mirage Court.
Vlamdir knew the man's name and reputation, quite the legend in the magical mafia.
One of the most dangerous European mercenaries, specialized in tracnking.

"Why did you come?"

"I wanted to see my favourite nephew," Katya smiled, passing her hand through Vladmir's long hair.
He grumbled as he correctly reattached his cardigan, as Lucius and Augusta discreetly laughed.

"I also wanted to invite you four to the day of the dead.
Let me reassure you Neville, we will bring lighter alcohol for you," Katya laughed as the Gryffindor paled as he remembered the experience.

"To tell you the truth, we hope that Black and Lupin could join us," Lucius explained.

"If he is alive..." Vlamdir sighed.

"We hope so...
According the the trackers who met him, you badly injured him," Katya sighed.

Vlamdir lowered his eyes, uneasy at the memory of the amount of blood he had spilled in the small park in Surrey when they met.
Sighing again, Katya changed subjects and brought back good humour around the tabled.
They spent two hours together, before leaving their own way.

<hr>

When the small friends group came back from Hogsmeade late in the afternnon, they were exhausted.
They thus went back to their common room to get warm and change clothes.
Less than a quarter of an hour later, Professor Flitwick came to them and declared that they all had to immediately go to the Great Hall.

Somewhat disorientated, they joined the Hufflepuffs in the way, before realizing that the whole school was gathered in the Great Hall.

"Mister Entwhisle, Mister Kemenov, please follow me," Professor Flitwick told them discreetly, after he pulled them to the back of their House's line.

Surprised, both Ravenclaws left their ranks, their Housemates looking at them curiously, before they were escorted to a small room.
They met back with Hermione, Draco and Neville.

"What's happening?" Draco asked, frowning.

"The Fat Lady, the painting guarding our common room, was assaulted," Neville explained.
"It was Sirius Black."

"Every one is gather while they search the whole castle," Hermione contonued.
"According to McGonagall, they are making the Dementers enter the cuilding, and to protect us, we are confined to the Great Hall.

The door to the small room briskly opened, making all of them jump.

"Father?" Draco wondered aloud.
"Why are you here?"

Indeed, Lucius Malfoy had just come into the room, his cape and his ornament cane were gone.
He seemed much more imposing in his combat robes, far from his usual sofisticated outfit.
He also seemed more anxious.

"Augusta is taking care of the students.
Hermione, Vladmir, you come with me.
Neville, Draco, Kevin, you are here because we know that if they had disappeared without telling you, you'd have gone to look for them."

"You're looking for Black," Kevin understood.

"Indeed.
He is on the school premises.
Vlad, do you have the vial of his blood?" a low voice asked.

Sergei, who had just appeared in front of them, was carefully observing the young Kemenov.
Vlamdir had admitted having Sirius's blood during the talk in the Three Broomsticks, and that was all the vampired needed to spot him.
If the Animagus was within a five kilometres radius, Sergei would smell him.

"Why must Hermione come?" Valdmir worried for his friend.
She was not trained for combat, despite her talent for magic.

"I don't know how Black will be when we find him.
Her blood might be necessary to save him."

"How did he managed to pass through the Dementors?" Hermione wondered.

"Probably thanks to his Animagus form," the vampire sighed.
"And that is why you must not leave my side.
I don't know the Dementors will react to you, Hermione.
According to Draco, the Hogwarts Express one reacted positively.
I doubt they would assault you, but you could lure them in and that would be bad for us..."

They thus followed the vampire through the castle, accomanied by Lucius and Katya.
They had Augusta search the castle with the other professors to confuse others, and give them free reign to catch Sirius Black.
Sergei, after he took some time to smell the blood vial, quickly found his track.

They started from the Fat Lady portrait, and had walked through the corridors, crossed the park, until they reached the Forbidden Forrest.
Hermione and Vlamdir stared at each other anxiously.
The last time they went in the forrest, they had met Voldemort.
Those were not good memories...

Like during their last stay, the place was gloomy.
The air was cold and damp.
Fortunately, they did not attract any Dementors, maybe thanks to the two Patronuses.
A cheetah was purring next to Lucius, while a two-headed eagle had landed on Katya's shoulder, making Hermione curious.

"It's the Russian Tsars' symbol.
All Kemenovs have a two-headed eagle as their Patronus," Vladmir explained, fighting his anxiety.
What if Black had died from his injuries?
It was cold, and with the Demetors, why knew in what condition they would find him?
Why had that stupid Black rushed into the dragon's den?"

**"Vlamdir, calm down."**

**"Sorry..."** the Russian mumbled once more.

**"And stop saying your sorry,"** Katya sighed while stepping over a tree trunk.

"He's not far...
His smell is powerful," Sergei declared suddenly.

"It's getting colder, isn't it?" Hermione asked softly.

"Dementors?" Vald turned pale.

"Probably.
Sergei, go!" Katya ordered, launching her Patronus to follow Sergei, who had just disappeared using his superhuman velocity.

They quickly followed the tails of light left by their Patronuses.

After a few minutes running between the trees and stumbling over their roots, they eventually reached an oxbow lake.
A human form was on the ground, in the middle of a rock beach, supported by the vampire.
The two Patronuses were protecting Sergei and Sirius Black, surrunded by a dozen Dementors.

"He is unconscious," the vampired yelled out, as Katya and Lucius were casting their Patronus again to move the Azkaban guardians away.

Hermione, under a sudden impetus, screamed at them to go back to their initial post, and a wave of magic sprang from them.
It brushed the Dementors, and they shivered, before slowly disappearing, obeying her order.

"I...
I think you sent them back to the castle gates," Lucius noted with surprise.

"Maybe even Azkaban," Katya added, thoughtful, while looking at the lake.

"But it's...
But...
it's... it's...
it's not possible!"
Hermione stuttered, before remembering the Dementor in the train.
Shocked, she stumbled and Katya needed to support her.
Katya reassured her softly, explaining that she had a gift over any and all magical creatures...

Meanwhile, Vladmir had kneeled down next to his godfather and removed the ragged shirt, discovering the injuries.
The skeletal body and marked by years of starvation was gashed by large infected wounds.

"What spell did you use?" Sergei asked, brushing the fugitive's forehead.
"He's bruning."

"A cutting spell infused with Dark Magic, so that he could not heal himself," Vladmir whispered, casting an ineffective spell.
**"Merlin, what have I done?"**

"Sepsis and anemia, as well as chronic fatigue and starvation," Lucius diagnosed thanks to a quick spell.
"He need a Mediwizard and quick healing.
Hermione, do you know how to do it?"

"I don't," the young girl whispered, sitting down next to Vladmir, still supported by Katya.

"He needs to drink some of your blood," Lucius exaplained calmly.

"But he's unconscious!"

_"Enervatum,"_ Katya whispered, pointing her wand on the man.

Vladmir saw the hollowed face of his godfather.
His eyes fluttered around before slowly opening.
Sirius Black's irises, of a deep grey, were hazy because of the fever and turned to Sergei's bloodshot eyes with great difficulty.

"What..."

In a feeble attempt to defend himself, Black struggled, but Sergei overpowered him as softly as possible.

"Calm down Black, you are safe now...
Hermione!"

The young licorine let Lucius cut her wrist witha  spell and put it over the man's lips.
She opened her eyes wide as she saw her blood take a golden tint as it flowed over Black's chin.

"Drink," Sergei growled, his red eyes burning with hunger at the enchanting smell of the young girl's blood overwhelmed his senses.
He fought his instincts and softly massaged the fugitive's throat to help him swallow.

Sirius Black, mouth full of a thick liquid, forced himself to swallow, and he felt a soft warmth in his body.
A few seconds later, he felt his consciousness drift again, but he heard three small words.
Three words coming from a voice he knew...

"I am sorry."

He barely had time to look at the two green eyes.
A shade of green he had seen recently.
But they did not have hate in them any more...

"Harry..."
