# Chapter 45: Meetings between Magical Creatures

"I think it's the first time that we all take the Hogwarts Express together," Hermione noted, comfortably nestling against Draco.
The latter, to be more comfortable, put his arms around the young girl's waist, while pushing his rook on the chessboard on Hannah Abbott's lap.
His gesture made his friends smile mockingly, which Draco ignored in a typical Malfoy manner.

"Indeed, I have never seen you in the return train, Vladmir," Theodore declared while munching on a Chocolate Frog.
Luna Lovegood was half lying on him and Kevin, reading the Quibbler upside down, atrocious glasses on her nose.
It must be said that they were 12 in a compartment that was designed for half as many people.
Fortunately, they all knew how to charm their suitcases…

Compartment 5 of carriage 9 of the Hogwarts Express was overflowing, and yet the atmosphere was appeased, despite the mix of Houses.
The group project had done a wonderful job, and in one year, the relationships between the Houses were not seen as negatively.

"It's the first time I stay in Britain for the start of the holidays," the Russian explained calmly, sitting on the groups, looking at his cards and the game in front of him.
"All-in."

"It's not possible, you're cheating," Neville grumbled, leaning back onto Susan's legs, who blushed slightly, but did not protest.
Contrary to Hannah, who had been invited to come to their compartment and frankly blushed at the Longbottom Heir's brazenness, especially since he was supposed to be pathologically shy.
Daphne Greengrass mumbled that he had Leprechaun cards in his hands, and declared that she folded, while Blaise, smiling, simply called.

"You're going to lose," Cedric said, who had an unobstructed view of the Ravenclaw's flush.

"I doubt it," the Slythrin sniggered.

"What do you have Zabini?"

"Show your hand, Kemenov!"

"The future ruined one goes first!"

"Four aces!"

"Flush!" the Ravenclaw revealed with a satisfied smile.
"Here come the riches!"

With an ample gesture, he took the pile of Galleons that was on the ground between them.

"What are you doing?" an easily identifiable voice asked.

"We are playing cards, Professor," Vlamdir answered the Charms Professor with a smile.

The Goblin quinted his entirely black eyes, then smiled, revealing his teeth that were too sharp for a human.

"Then allow me to join you…"

Calmly, ignoring half of the compartment's astonishement as they had no idea of his implication with the Mirage Court, Filius Flitwick settled down between the second and third year students.
He invoked Leprechaun gold to play wiht an amused rictus, and preceeded to conscientiously fleece the four students.

$You are a true thief$, Vladmir grumbled, making their Charms Professor smile as he pocketed the true coins, for a total of 500 Galleons.

$No dear, I am a Goblin$.
"We'll be there in 15 minutes, be ready!"

And, with 500 Galleons more in his pocket, the Charms Professor got out as calmly as when he arrived, under the astounded smiles of every one.

"Did he just…"

"Make off with 500 Galleons?
Yeah, he did," Blaise mumbled.

"He did know they were real Galleons, didn't he Vlad?" Neville asked.

"Of course, he is a Goblin," Vladmir sighed.

"That's what I called being fleeced," Draco laughed.

"And as Vladmir declared that it was Leprechaun gold, you can't do anything," Hermione added.

"At this point, it's not getting fleeced, it's getting fu…
Hmmm!"

Hermione had just gagged Kevin, preventing him from saying the vulgar word that was about to leave his mouth.

"It's quite strange that he came to play with you," Hannah noted shyly.

"Not really," Kevin explained.
"Professor Flitwick spends at least an hour every night in the Ravenclaw Common Room, and he generally talks or participates in board games.
It's his way to ensure that there is no problem in the House, and especially make himself available."

"You're lucky," Hermione sighed.
"McGo is cool and all, but she rarely ever comes in the Common Room.
You always have to run after her in the corridors or go to her office…"

"Same for Professor Prince, but his office door is linked to the Common Room, and you only have to knock to get welcomed in."

"And for Hufflepuffs?" Daphne asked with curiosity, making the two Hufflepuff girls blush, who were not used to talking with other Houses, apart from their quite peculiar group.

"Professor Sprout comes at least once a week in the Greenhouses and…"

"So your Comon Room is in the Greenhouses?" Neville said in amazement.
"Can I come visit?
Cedric always refused!"

Hannah and Susan were scarlet red and did not know what to do with themselves as the Gryffinsor was kneeling in front of them, with pleading eyes.
He was far from the shy Neville they were used to seeing, but apparently, he was way more relaxed with his friends…
A moment's hesitation passed, then the compartment broke out laughing.

It was in this good humour, especially with this promise extracted from the two Hufflepuffs to have access to their Common Room, that they reached King's Cross station.

There, calmly sitting down in a corner of the station, were a few personalities that turned a few heads.
Ladies and Lords Malfoy, Greengrass, Nott, Longbottom, Bones, and the Kemenov matriarch were waiting for their respective heirs, talking among themselves.
Two know "Light" families, and three "Dark" families…

As the small group of compartment 5 of carriage 9 got out, Hannah Abott, Blaise Zabini, and Luna Levgood were dragged by their friends towards the members of the wizarding Nobility.

"Father," Draco started calmly, "I know you already have met Blaise, please allow me to introduce you to Hannah Abott, _Seniorem_ of the Noble and Anctient House Abott, as well as the Heir Luna Lovegood."

"Please to meet you, youngsters," the Malfoy patriarch declared with a slight smile.
"I have heard about you through my son and his friends."

And, under the astounded looks of bystanders, the official presentations continued with each parent, while the families of the three children were approaching incredulously, although a dreamy blonde man was softly smiling.
Hannah's mother, as well as Blaise mother and father, were quite disorientated by the presentations they children were given to such illustrious wizards and witches.

While everyone was talking about Vladmir's future birthday party, Hermione was looking for her parents.
It was the first time the Grangers were late, but Augusta quickly reassured her.

"Don't worry Hermione, they are just a few minutes late because of something unexpected happened."

Indeed, a few moments laters, the Grangers appeared, alongside an unknown man and a young girl who looked around ten years old.

"Who are those people?" Hermione asked with curiousity, pointing to a tall man with sickly traits that stood next to her mother.

"My father," Kevin grew pale as Hermione's mother waved energetically at her only daughter's friends.
She had invited them all for the beginning of the holidays in the Granger's suburban house.
Dr. Jan Granger had been delighted to know the first true friends of her wonderful daughter aside from the magical areas.

"Is that your sister?" Hermione asked, seeing the young girl's blue eyes, which, contrary to her brother's, were warm and curious.

"Yes, Mary-Ann," Kevin nodded, as he thought about the various possible reasons of their presence this day.

"You father and sister, huh?" Draco sniffed, carefully looking at Warren Entwhstle's worn clothes.
"Sorry for saying that, but he looks like Lupin the day after a fool moon."

As they had seen their werewolf professor a few hours after he ahd transformed, they all could tell it was not a pretty sight.

Nearly imediately, as the Muggle looked in panic all around him, he finally saw his son.
The strange sparkled in his eyes immediately made Kevin's friends wary.
Nevill, Hermione, Draco, and Vlamdir stood next to the young Ravenclaw to support him.
In a few strieds, Warren Entwhistle got in front of them, dragging a curious but scared Mary-Ann.
However, a spark of joy brightened her eyes when she saw her brother.

"Kevin…"

"Dad."

The man did not know what to say, and was extremely undeasy, judgin from his slight blush and the way he could not look at his son.
Mrs. Granger kissed her daugher, before joining the other parents, leaving Warren Entwhistle to face the Alliance.

"I… I'd like…"

"Kevin stayed silent, until Mary-Ann slowly approached him and softly pulled on his robes.
The Ravenclaw turned away from his father and kneeled in front of his sister.

"Did you make butterflies appear again?" he asked softly.
Mary-Ann simply nodded shyly, before handing him a parchment letter.
The torn Hogwarts seal was easily identifiable.

"You didn't tell us your sister was a witch," Hermione smiled.

Warren, ignored by everyone, seemed close to apoplexy while they all congratulated the young girl for her gifts.
The second witch in the Entwhistle family.

"You… I…"

Kevin gave him a sharp look, and gestured for Neville and Vlad to follow hil.
At the same time, Draco and Hermione distracted the young girl while the three wizards got the father further away.

"Did you hurt her?" Kevin suddenly growled.

"What? No!"

"Did Gordon approach her?"

"No," Warren whispered.
"Listne Kevin, I am…"

"I don't care about your apologies, dad.
I never truly was your son, too 'weird', 'queer'…
'The lonely Doncaster brainiac', if I remember correctly.
Unstruprisingly, my wonderful older brothers have always imitated their brilliant father.
The only one who accepted me was Mary-Ann.
So I won't repeat myself again…
Did someone hurt my little sister?"

Neither Vlamdir nor Neville reacted.
They knew that life at the Entwhistles was not good, but to see the father and son so distant was painful, especially since neither of them really knew their fathers.

"No," the Muggle eventually said.
"Listen, I'd like to a…"

"Shut up!"

The typical Parsletongue hiss made Warren jump, while some wizards and witcehs around them imperceptibly walked away, uneasy at the whirling magic.

"Don't even think about saying 'sorry', or 'I apologize'!
You…"

"Kevin, calm down, you're about to lose control of your magic," Neville said softly, putting a hand on his shoulder.

`Breathe, brother`, Vladmir hissed softly.
The Ravenclaw obeyed and breathed in deeply.
When he opened his eyes again, his eyes were ice-cold.

"He went to the right school," Lucius sniggered, observing from the argument between the two Entwhistle from the corner of his eye, while Hermione and Draco led Mary-Ann in a visit of the Hogwarts-Express.

"What were you saying dear?"

Katya had not listened to a word her companion had said and gave him an apologetic smile.
Lucius held back his impulse to roll his eyes‑a bit of restraint and manners in public, Merlin‑but he could not help but smile and pointed to the two Entwhistles.

"We could make an honorary Russian out of him," Katya said, discreetly pricking up her ears.

"You have always ignored me, dad!" The Ravenclaw enunciated without any emotion.
"Never a compliment, never any criticism.
Only negligence.
I came here alone for my first year.
You never made the effort to come get me, ask about my gardes.
You were satisfied when McGonagall came to tell you taht I would disappear from the house 10 months out of 12, you were euphoric at the news, and…"

"Kevin…"

"No, shut up!" he repeated.
"You want me to take care of Mary-Ann, don't you?"

"Yes."

"I will do it.
As I have done since her birth.
Now, I'm telling you that I will not come home during the holidays.
I have seen the only person I missed, and especially since I will see here for three quarters of the year starting from now, so…
Farewell!"

And Kevin, without saying any more, turned away from his father to go back to his little sister.

"One more thing," he added while stopping slightly to look daggers at Warren Entwhistle.
"If you let 'Uncle Gordy' approach her, I will know, and I will make sure to kill this man!"

"Why…
Why Gordon?" the man stuttered, looking at his son leave towards his friends.

"Why?" Neville asked calmly while looking intently at Kevin's father.
"I know little about you, Mr. Entwhistle, but I know that Kevin was not happy because neither your nor his brothers ever made any effort…
Even after you learned about his nature."

And Neville went back in turn to get back to the others who joyfully talked, even if all carefully looked at the Muggle, now alone with one of the most dangerous Hgowarts students.

"You never touched Kevin… contrary to his uncle," Vladmir declared.
"If by chance, I meet this infamous… Gordon… I will kill him.
You do not touch a peer of the magical kingdom without consequences."

"A… A peer?" the man stuttred, making vlamdir smile.
A smile that sent shivers down Warren's spine.

"Vlamdir Kemenov, Lord Potter, Prince of the Ancient Magical Kingdom," Vladmir introduced himself with the same terrifying smile.
"Knight-Mage Kevin Entwhistle-Potter is untouchable.
Remember this…"

"One more thing," Vlad declared.
"We will get Mary-Ann on the first of August to get her school supplies."

While Vladmir concluded this charming conversation with Kevin's father, Draco and Hermione laughed when they saw the grimace on Mary-Ann's lips.

"So, what flavour?" Kevin asked, kneeling next to his sister.
She huddled up against her brother and whispered something to him.

"Banana?"

Kevin laughed while explaining to the others that she never liked that fruit.

**"She only speaks to you,"** Vladmir said softly so that Mary-Ann did not understand, while being less scary that Parsletongue.

**"She is pathologically shy with strangers,"** Kevin whispered.
"Hey, Kitten, you will go back home with dad, okay?"

Her eyes, identical to her brothers, met his, and he softly brushed her face as she shook her head.

"Come on kitten, we will see each other on the first day of school, the first of September."

"To tell you the truth, no, we will get you to spend one day of initiaion to the Muggle world," Vladmir smiled, leaning towards Mary-Ann.
"The first of August," he added, seeing her questionning eyes, which immediately turned to a joyful expression.

To the two Ravenclaws' surprise, Mary-Ann timidly kissed Vlad's cheek before running back to her father.

"What…"

"The first of August is her birthday," Kevin smiled.
"You have just given her a magnificant gift.
Since she has learned that magic exists, she has dreamt of accompanying me on Diagon Alley.
She has read all my books on the magical world, even the wizarding etiquette one, that's saying something!"

All laughed, knowing that those books were boring and laborious to read, and thus in they spent their first week of holidays in reative good humour, as they all waited for Peter Pettigrew's trial.
The only bad thing were Vladmir's frequent disappearances.
He was regualarly going to the _Tube_, the _Underground_'s hidout underneath the London Underground.
He hoped to learn more about the precise location of Albus Dumbeldore, but no one knew aything…
No one except Sergei, and therefore Katya.

Thus, despite Vlamdir's repeated absences, the Alliance core was waiting to go to the Grangers' home at the end of the first week of holidays, while planning all they had to do during the rest of the holidays.
Indeed, they were busy this year.
Thye had a trial, as well as the Quidditch World Cup, Vladmir's and Neville's birthady, the day on Diagon Alley with Mary-Ann, and that did not take the numerous invitations at the Bones's, the Notts's and various other friends.

They were all gathered in the playroom of Malfoy Manor's children wing, their residence for those first few days.

"How come we are all invited in so many places?" Neville grumbled, lying down on the carper.
He was not used to participating to society life, especially so varied activities.
He was horrified at the many invitations to tea and even the ball to many personalities of the magical world.
Until now, his false shyness had avoided him a social life with other children, and this escloak those events.
He hadn't got a choice any more, as those invitations followed many rules of Pure-Blood etiquette.

"My dear Neville, welcome to the Pure-Blood world," Draco sniggered, perfectly at ease on his seat, Hermione sitting in the comfortable wing chair besides him.

"Does any one know where Vladmir has gone again?" Kevin enventually asked, raising the book that was covering his face, which had allowed him to nap in the middle of the afternoon on the deep green sofa in the room, his familiars curled on his belly.

"Sergei came to take him out a few minutes ago, when you were snoring like a trooper," Draco smiled, before receiving a cushion in the face.

"I do not snore!"

"No!"

Hermione looked up from her book, and slightly smaked her tongue, a noise her friends had lurned to recognise perfectly well, thus avoiding a sterile debate.
Her Stinging Hexes were devastating, and quite painful…

"He must have things to prepare for the trial."

"Or he's tracking Dumbledore," Kevin sighed.

And he was perfectly right, because to say the truth, Vladmir was not in Malfoy manor any more, but in London, along with Sergei.
They had just entered one of the Tube entrances in Piccadilly Circus, wearing Muggle clothes.
As they followed the flow of busy Londoners, they reached the crowded platforms quickly.

**"Where are we goin?"** Vladmir asked, sighing as he pushed a young ma covered in piercings who refused to move, despite Vladmir politely asking.

**"In the tunnels,"** the vampire responded.
**"You will have to do magic."**

Vladmir obeyed and discreetely waved his wand, using the Russian equivalent of the Muggle-repelling charm.
Immediately, all around him started to look everywhere but towards him, and he jumped on the rails.

**"Careful, the central rail is electrified!"**

**"You're telling me only now?"** the wizard grumbled while avoiding said rail, making the vampire laugh mockingly.

They started to slowly walk the dark tunnels, staying close to the walls to avoid getting hit by the metro cars that ran at full speed.
Despite the danger, Vladmir observed the place with curiosity.
Dark, damp, and quite dirty, he could however feel the magic present around.
Among the discoloured graffitis, he could see in some places magical runes carved in the concrete.
And the small being that holed up in the corners were certainly not rats.
The ground under London was full of various magical beasts.

If Vladmir remembered correctly, only one clan lived in the London Underground's tunnels around Piccadilly Circus.
A clan Vladmir was not looking forward to meeting.
As the smell of piss hurt his through, Sergei suddenly took a turn towards a small passage half hidden by cardboard boxes and old tarps.
The scratch marks, five electric blue, parallel lines above the entrance were significant.
Sergei was bringing him in the wolf's den…

"What is a Death-Walker doing on the Wolves of London's territory?" a menacing voice suddenly growled.

"Hi Jack," Sergei smiled, appearing in the light.
"Your guards told you about my presence quite quickly."

"Well, well, well, none other than the St-Petersburg Knyaz…
My wolves tell me about the smallest movements in my tunnels.
What are a vampire and a human doing here?
Unless you are bringing me fresh flesh?" the man asked, sniffing towards Vladmir.

"I'd like to see you try, Riper."

"Showing your teeth, Pup?" the man sniggered, entering the dim artificial light, revealing wild amber eyes and a tawny mane closer to a lion's than a wolf's.

"I assure you you don't want to bite him," Sergei declared.

"Why is that?"

"He is the Prince Potter."

"The _Prince_?"

Jack Riper leaned towards Vladmir, and carefully looked at him, noting hin green eyes and the hair only partially tamed by its length."

"A Potter…
_The_ Potter, the one who survived… with a Russian accent!?"

"Vladmir Vassilievitch Kemenov," he introduced himself.

"Jack iper…
Something tells me you are not the true prince.
You are an alpha, kid, but you do not small like royalty.
However, I don't want to make an enemy of the king by killing one of his highest subjects," Jack added with a rictus.

Vlamdir did not answer, but he mentally laughed.
The King…
Severus would have a stroke when he would tell him that.

"Follow me…"

Two men suddenly appeared behind them, preventing any possibility of escloak, and they slowly walked through the tunnel behind Jack.

**"If he is turning his back to you, it means that he does not fear you, right?"** Vladmir asked suspiciously.
And he was not wrong.
Werewolves, especially an Alpha like Jack Riper, the leader of the most powerful pack in Britain, never turned their back to an enemy or a potentially dangerous person.

**"He knows he needs not fear me, unlike Valerius.
And he is probably underestimating you, although he gathered that since you are with me, you are reliable, even if he correctly estimated you."**

**"I still have much to learn on Magical Creatures…"**

**"You never stop learning, Kitten,"** Sergei smiled, affectionately passing a hand in Vladmir's hair, while Jack Riper looked at their every move in the corner of his eyes.
The werewolf knew the vampire well, especially after he had proven to the London vampire clan's leader that he was more powerful than him.
He knew that he would not come for nothing, and he was curious to know the reason for his visit, especially since he was with one of the descendants of the Knight-Mages.

They eventually reached a huge toom under London, as large as a park.
Dozens of makeshift huts were planted in the dedicated place.
Made from hessian, cardboards or corrugated iron, they were small and convoluted, but they had a certain warmth to them.
Several people were standing around a fire, wearing a mix of wizarding and Muggle clothes, and Vlamdir could see laughing children playing with a football.

"Welcome to the Riper pack's village," the werewolf declared before reassuring the group of wolves around a campfire, then a man slightly away from them.
"My right-hand man, Karl."

"Your Beta?" Vlamdir asked, carefully observing the man, who gave out a wild aura not unlike his Alpha's."

Jack looked at the young man sharply, before looking at Sergei.

"Russians accept magical races more readily."

"That's what I've heard," Jack declared, guiding them towards one of the small huts.
"I longely hesitated to bring my pack to another country after werewolf repression laws passed."

Sergei and Vladmir entered and discovered not a hut, but a full-on house.
Despite their pariah status, they had access to enough magic to create wizarding houses.

"The exterior façade is for Muggles in the unlikely event that one of them managed to pass through the confinment runesn" Riper explained, noticing Vlad's attentive gaze.
"They'd think it's a simple homeless encampment."

"Ingenious," Vladmir agreed.

"Tea?"

"With pleasure."

The werewolf quickly prepared the tea, and Vladmir noticed that magic was not only used for their houses, as Jack used a strange instinctive magic to help himself navigate daily life.
As the Russians accepted a cup, the camp's Beta entered and sat down nearby, looking at them with a wild gaze.

"Now, to what do I owe the dubious pleasure of your visit?"

"We want to know the identity of one of Valerius's guests, and to know that we have your support when we will pay him a visit later."

A threatening growl came out of Jack's chest as he showed his teeth, and Vlamdir carefully observed the reaction.
Contrary to Lupin, who did not have any physical manifestation of lycanthropy apart from his amber eyes, Jack Riper and the other wolf, had sharper than average teeth and claws on their hands.

"Why should I know the guests of this Roman asshole?"

"Because, not only you hate him, but also you have his closely watched by the House Elves he employs."

"And why would I give you this information?"

"Because of one those guests probably is Albus Dumbledore."

Jack Riper's reaction was more violent than what Vladmir had expected.
The wolf not only threw the cups and ravaged half the room by a explosion of magic, but he also transformed into a huge wolf, which started to bite and claw at the sofa.
Sergei pushed the young wizard in a corner and stood in front of him, protecting him.

**"Why is the trasformation dfferent?"** Vladmir suddently asked, fascinated by the wolf's natural aspect, far from the unnarutal beast they had seen in Hogwarts.
**"And especially, how is it possible outside the full moon?"**

**"He comes from a line.
He has learned to accept his wolf a long time ago…
Shit!"**

The fact that they had talked had caught the attention of the Magical Creature who approached them, growling.
Sergei prepared to jump, but the wolf suddenly stopped a metre away from them and curiously sniffed the air before sitting down and tilted his head to the side, silent.

**'What…"***

"Alpha…"

The man Jack had named Karl, who has stayed put until then, motioned for the two guests to not move and started to carefully approached his leader.

"Alpha?"

But Jack ignored him and crawled slightly yowards Vladmir.
Sergei, understanding that he did not mean any harm, let his approach the young wizard.
The wolf, who was as high as Vladmir's shoulder, sniffed the young Russian's clothes before taking back his human form.

"Alpha?" his right-hand wolf repeated again.

"It's alright Karl," the leader of the pack answered with a sore voice.
"Take care of the furniture."

The pack's Beta nodded and made a spectacular usage of wandless magic to repair the furniture.
Jack striaghtened up and grimaced as he saw his tattered clothes.
He groaned in displeasure and went to another room of the home, leaving two surprised Russians behind him.

"What happened?" Vladmir eventually asked.

"Your smell calmed him down, human.
Why, I don't know, but you could have been bitten.
Jack is pretty…"

"I'm quick to anger Karl, don't try to find another word."

Vladmir turned his head towards the Alpha who was entering the room, wearing old jeans and a typically Muggle shirt.
In a single glance around, Jack checked that his Beta had put everything back in order, and gestured for him to take his leave, which Karl did begrudgingly, not wanting to leave his Alpha alone with two strangers, especially wizards.

"Valerius currently has three human guests," the werewolf declared eventually while sitting down.
"The first one is a female who want to be transformed.
A haughty blonde noble, repudiated if I understood correctly.
She belongs to the magical high society."

Vladmir frowned and tapped the table with his wand to make a face appear on the surface.
Narcissa Black's face.

"Her?"

"Indeed.
Do you know who it is?" the Alpha asked.
Vlamdir did not try to hide information.
It was an exchange, after all.

"Narcissa Black, formerly Malfoy.
She is responsible for the fall of the _Underground_."

"Then my men will get the order to kill her on sight."

Even if Jack did not belong to the Mirage Court, he had enough respect for this huge web of fencers, thieves and other magical society rejecs that they had managed to create.
He care for it somewhat, knowing his wolves had always been able to take refuge in one of the three magical taverns under the _Underground_'s seal, and even afterwards.
The fall of the _Underground_ had caused serius issued to the Riper pack.
Because apart from the neutral zones that magical taverns linked to the Courts kept open, most packs had created strong links with the Mirage Court to survive.
It was especially true for British packs, where werewolves were pesecuted and marginalized.

"The second one is a French wizard.
He stinks of death, and according to my men, he regularly is food."

"Any strong link with Valerius?"

"Not that we know of."

"Not interesting to us," Sergei declared.

"And the last one is a ginger man with blue eyes."

"Dumbledore."

"He is too young to be this old senile bastard."

"Transfiguration.
All wizards know him as an old man with a long white beard, so if he takes the face he had when he was young, not many can recognise him," Vladmir declared slowly.
"Why did you react so badly at his name?"

"He is responsible for half the laws against werewolves and forbid our education in Hogwarts."

"Werewolves never were accepted in Hogwarts," Vladmir said, frowning.

"Oh, we were," the werewolf laughed joylessly.
"All bitten wizards and the ones born from a wolf could go, as long as they could handle their wolf.
Since he bacame a Professor, Dumbeldore systematically refused to enroll our race.
Durmstrang still accepts us, as does Coldrock.
The only exception is one of Greyback's pup he managed to admirably manipulate…" the werewolf added for himself.

"So, do you accept to cover is when we will meet with Valerius?" Sergei finally asked.

"Even better, I will come with you," Jack smiled slyly.
"I want Valerius's head.
If this despicable human who pretends himself the leader of the Light is truly there, it's reason enough to kill him."

"Perfect," Vladmir smiled, standing up.

"Before we go kick Valerius's cold butt, I have a question for you, Pup."

Vladmir and Sergei exchanged a discreet look, and the Ravenclaw slowly nodded his head, sitting back down.
Uneasy, but keeping his inscrutable face, his life face as the Goblins called it, he observed the Alpha stand up and come to carefully smell him.

"You have a particular small on you.
A very powerful smell.
A smell born wolves like myself know very well…
A smell that is embedded in your skin and clothes, which tells me you know her well…"

"Her?"

"Dame-à-la-Licornes are always women, Jack calmly declared, his shining amber eyes a dozen centimetres from Vladmir's face.

"She is too young," Sergei intervened softly.
"She is only 14."

"That's old enough."

"Not for her to knowingly choose.
Do you want her to regret her choice for the rest of her life?"

The werewolf and the vampire stared at each other, then Jack softly shook his head.

"I don't.
However, I insist that she meets with one of my clan's wolves, so that she gets an idea of what an werewolf truly is."

"I want an oath that you will not tell every other Magical Creature that a Licorine appeared."

"They must learn about her at some point," the werewolf justified himself.

"No like this.
She will reveal herself when she is ready," Vladmir declared.

The werewolf stepped back slightly and voluntarily looked into the teenager's eyes, noticing the cold resolution in the emeral green eyes.
Jack Riper briefly wondered whether this Russian was part ofthe Mirage Court, or if he was only Sergei's pupil.
The Russian vampired had always appreciated the presence of humans, contraty to most of his kind, and he knew he regularly bound himself with quite peculiar wizarding families.
He did not know much about the Kemenovs, but for the St-Petersburg Knyaz to be linke to the child, it meant that he had either a blood or emotional link.
In any case, he did not want to make an enemy of the Russian vampire, whoever the Kemenovs were.

"Katya Annapovna Kemenov is a former Auror and a dangerous Clan chief, as well as Lucius Malfoy's current partner," Sergei declared, as if he had read the Alpha's thoughts.
And Jack wondered if he had, judging from Sergei's mocking smile.

"Isn't it his wife crashing as the blood suckers'?" the werewolf mumbled.

"It is," Vladmir laughed.
"She is his ex wife…
And she will soon be disowned by the Black family as well."

"How can you be so sure, kid?" Jack sniffled, standing up to get a drink.
Apparently, tea was not the usual when negociating between magical creatures.
They preferred stronger alcohols, like Firewhiskey.
Vladmir accepted the glass and slightly raised it.

**"Cheers, comrade,"** he said right before gulping it down, the werewolf looking at him, astounded.
After a few seconds, to ensure that it was not mere bravado and that he would not cough, collaspe, or faint at the alcohol's burn, Jack laughed out loud and slaped his back.

"I like you, Pup!
Do all Russians know how to drink like you?"

"We have to keep warm in the winter," Vlad sniggered, before becoming more serious.
"Do we have your oath for the Licorine?"

"Do I have your word that you will weaken Valerius?" the wolf countered, keeping them a second glass in reserve.

"We have a deal, then," Sergei smiled, taking a small knife from his boot, which he used to cut his palm. Jack did the same, but Vladmir did not.
Involuntary transformation by blood contamination was not in his projects.
He simply drank his second glass as fluidly as the first one.

"When do you want to meet Valerius?"

"Today," Sergei laughed, who had patiently waited for the werewolf to start drinking.
Unsurprisingly, the Firewhiskey went down the wrong way and Jack chocked and loudly coughed, repeatedly insulting the Vampire on his typically human mischievousnesss that he had kept despite his venerable age.

<hr>

Thus, the two Russians and the werewolf, still mumbling wears, calmly crossed London, using the quite practical London Underground to go to one of the large palaces a few steps from Buckingham Palace.
Jack Riper had given Karl the interim leadership of his pack, but another of his dominant wolves, a female named Mattie, was slowly following them silently.

"Frankly, Vampires always had a taste for luxury," Jack grumbled as he looked at the impressive Victorian home.
"I'm sure you live in a palace!" he accused Sergei.
The latter gave him a sharp smile as he nonchanantly pushed up the black glasses that hid his inhuman eyes to the Muggles.

"Of course.
It is just in front of the Winter Palace!
One of my sons is Nicolas II of Russia, after all!"

"Tsk, you hear that young man?
Mister is upper clas!" the werewolf mocked.

"Vladmir is in no position to say mock me for that, aren't you, Tsesarevich Vladmir Vassilievitch?"

"Shut up, Sergei," Vladmir sighed, secretly amused by the friendly banter between the two men.
They had spent all the trip teasing one another, with Vladmir looking on, surprised.
It was the first time he saw Sergei so comfortable with someone outside of his clan and clan Kemenov…

"Tsesarevich?
Like the title given to the future Czar of Russia?"

"Indeed, our young boy here descends from the wizarding branch of the Romanovs," Sergei was amused, ruffling his ward's hair, who groaned in response.

"Tsk…
In addition to being a Prince of the Five Families, Mister is an Imperial Highness," Jack sniffed, still giving him a mocking smile.
Since he had met Vladmir, he liked the boy.
He had a string will, powerful magic, and especially an open mind, which radically differed from most in the British wizarding nobility.

"What are we wating for now?" Jack asked, as Sergei had them stop in the middle of the path of the opulent gardens.

"Our own escort, Valerius likes decorum," Vladmir said, pointing to the gardens
"You can be sure that there will be a strong presence with him, and we will thus avoid presenting ourselves weakened."

"The fact that we are all accompanied by someone is primordial for official meetings between high-ranking vampires, as are the outfits, bearing…"

"I don't really see the decorum there," Mattie mumbled, pointing to them, especially the simple jeans that the two Russians were wearing.

Jack frowned and laughed slightly when he finally realized that the leather smell around them was coming from their true clothes, not the powerful illusion that surrounded them.
However, he mumbled that they could have given them a heads-up to prepare a bit.
To the two wolves' surprise, Sergei pointed to Vladmir, who took out his wand to transfigure Mattie's unremarkable beige trousers into a wonderful dress with Empire silhouette of the same colour, to which he added a deep purple cloak with the emblem of the Riper pack, five blue diagonal scratches  on a sable field.

As the she-wolf was starting to complain about the lack of movement allowed with this roe, Vladmir sighed and waved his wand.
A long slit appeared beginning from her thigh to the base of ther dress, and the wolf gave him a small thankful smile before adjusting her weapon, which had appeared around her thigh thanks to the magic of the young Ravenclaw.

Then, following the Alpha's recommendations, Vladmir gave Jack black wool trousers as well as a simple grey shirt, which he covered with a cloak the exact colour of his pack's emblem.

"What about you?" Mattie asked, looking at the two Russians, who let their illusion fall.
The traditionnal Russian robes, richly ornamented with velvet and furst were covered wth a leather cloak for Vladmir, and a fur one for Sergei, on which were their respective coat-of-arms…
Which were quite complex in Vladmir's case.

**"You look smart,"** somone declared suddenly while stepping out of the shadows, also wearing Russian formal dress.

**"Nikolai!"** Vladmir exclaimed, jumping into the vampire's arms, who laughed while petting his head.
**"Anton?"**

"Jack, this is my right-hand man, Nikolai, and one of the clan Kemenov guards Anton," Sergei introduced them.
"Nikolai, Anton, this is Jack, and one of his wolfes, Mattie."

"Noce to meet you," Nikolai smiled, with his thick Slavic accent, while Anton, who did not speak English one bit, simple greeted them with a nod.
"Let's go, shall we?"

Jack observed Vladmir Vassilievitch Kemenov straighten up to take a more imposing posture, his face now expressionless.
He seemed a good ten years older, his emeral green eyes now black.
The two werewolves knew at that moment that this kind had killed, cold-bloodedly.
Outside his dangerous appearance, the Russian gave of an aura that sent chills down their spines.
Anton, the family's guard, went to his post on Vladmir's right, a few centimetres back.

Sergei slightly modified his bearing, and the werewolves groaned slightly when, without hiding it, the vampires took their real appearance.
The corpse-like skin, the blueish veins, the sharp fangs…
They stank of death and desolation and, reacting to the unveiled presence of their mortal ennemie, the two lycanthropes let out a few inhuman traits.
Pointy, hairy ears appeared, while the white of their eyes fully turned amber, their iris disappearing, only leaving the pupil, although they kept their wild and fascinating appearance as wolf-borns.

And thus they finally started the wizard-hunt.
Calmly, the small group reached the porch which, unsurprisingly, opened before they even could known.
The London's vampire clan had probably followed their every move since they had entered the gardens.

"The Master is awaiting you," a young Vampire declared, carefully looking at Vladmir and Anton, before squinting his nose haughtily as the werewolves were passing him.
Jack simply ignored him, and Mattie copied his attitude, even if it was obvious she was excited fr a fight with a vampire.

As they were let through the impressive entrance and the unending stairs, the eyes of the six guests looked at all the uncovered spots, noticing any interesting detail that could possibly help them.
The smell of blood was slight, but present everywhere in the abode.
Another small, more acrid, bothered the four Magical Creatures.
A mix of fear, sex, and urnie.
A small they did not appreciate, a symbol of the decadence of certain vampires, who basked in lust and murder.

A few minutes after they had entered the Valerius palace, they were led to a large drawing room, Sergei first.
There, the master of the house, a vmapire with long, strawberry blond hair, smiling affably, was lounging with a young Veela, as blonde as him.
While the room was expectly decorated, the light of day had been curtained off, and a fire was dimly lighting the room, making the ambiance heavy in this start of july.
THe smells were also more marked in this drawing room, making Sergei, Nikolai, Jack, and Mattie uneasy.
And they would especially guess that behind Valerius Dominius, leader of the vampire clan reigning over all of England, were several vampires hiding in the shadows.

"Master Valerius, the Knyaz Pokhastovine, the Alpha Riper, and the Heir Kemenov," their guide announced them.
Valerius raised his head and exchanged a glance with Sergei, before focusing on Vlamdir, then Jack.
Unsurprisingly he did not note the presence of their pairs, although they knew perfectly well their absence would have been a faux pas.
The expressions were perfectly readable on Valerius's face, while the young Veela stayed put, lying on the wing chair.

First, there was wariness…
Sergei and Valerius did not like each other, and the latter still held a grudge against the Russian vampire for having beaten and humiliated in public, even though he was younger than Valerius, and thus theoretically weaker.
Valerius, whose full name was Valerius Aelius Augustus Dominius, was a contemporary of and a member of Hadrian's family, a Roman emperor in the secnd century CE.
He was thus approaching his second millenium.
Sergei Pokhastovine's age was one of the best guarded secrest, but he could only be younger than him.
Valerius was one of the most ancient vampires, and he knew all the oldest ones.
His defeat had enormously reduced his prestige and had started mockery about him, especially since Sergei had let him live, forcing him into a blood debt…

Then there was hatred…
To see two mutts in his home, even if he liked the power and wildness coming of from the two dominants, was triggering a visceral hatred inside himself.
Remus and Romulus, the two founders of Rome, was Magical Creatures…
The first known werewolves, in fact, and Rome had been the territory of lycanthropes…
Until the vampires invaded and changed the regime into a Republic.
Because of this, multiple wars were started, and they were the main reason of the hatred between the two raced.
Both camps had lost thousands of members because of the continuous conflicts started millenia ago…

Finally, there was curiosity and melancholy…
To see a young human standing fearlessly next to vampires and werewolves was refreshing.
Valerius had lived in England since he was transformed and he had followed the evolution of the wizarding customs.
Humans had always been terrified by them, but strangely, this child did not seem to feel anything…
An excellent mask and a perfect mastery of himself that he could only admire…
And it made old memories surface…
So old that they had not kept an image, only emotions…
Joy, love…
Valerius remembered a woman, a human…
One of the daughters of one of the first kings of what would become England.
Out of respect and love, he had not transformed her, and had accompanied her into her old age…

Someone slightly clearing their thraot took Valerius out of his thoughts, and he gave his guests a contrite smile, noting the amused look in Sergei's eyes, the young Kemenov's lack of expression, and especially, suspicion in the two lycantrhopes' eyes.

"Sergei…" the vmapire said amiably, not bothering to stand up, "to what do I owe your presence?"

"Did he realize that it's been half an hour?" Mattie suddenly whispered.

"The sad part of aging, girl," Valerius declared, trying to hold back his hatred and anger, as the memories of unending massacres and wars he had lived with this race came back to his mind.

"Old vampires have many memories, and they sometimes get lost in them," Vladmir explained in a blank voice, although he was still internally laughing at the vampire's absence. Seeing an old vampire staring into space and nearly drooling in front of them was hilarious…"

"Great, a crazy one…" Mattie grumbled, not paying attention to the warning growl from her Alpha.

She did not see danger arrive.
Without understanding how, she got pinned against a wall, fangs lacerating her throat and a iron grip preventing her from talking and breathing.
The pain was agonizing, and she was howling.
As suddenly as it had started, the attack stopped, her aggressor had been thrown across the room by Nikolai.

Jack took her back to the middle of the room unceremoniously, in front of Valerius, who had not moved, still smiling.
However his eyes burned in hatred and his vampiric traits had appeared.
With a kick, Jack Riper made her fall to the ground, kneeling and submissive, as she tried to contain the blood flowing from her lips.

"I appologize for her behaviour, Primate Valerius," Jack declared, using the title for the leader of a British vampiric clan, the equivalent to the Russian Knyaz, even if hurt him saying it.

"Watch your bitch, or I'll rip her tongue out next time," the vampire declared, still focused on the young Russian wizard.

Jack squinted when he noticed that Vladmir had not reacted during the attack, nor had Sergei.
However, he gave the Knyaz a nod to thank him for sending his right-hand man to help.
In an impercetible whisper, he told his solf off, ordering her to stop moving and to shut up if she did not want him to rip her out in front of Valerius to prove his good faith.
Jack hated getting to such extremities, but between a sacrifice and a war he was sure to lose triggered because of an insult, he preferred losing a wolf compared to his whole pack.

"I do not think you are here to insult me, so why are you here?"

"Not a drink to offer?" Sergei sniffled, falsely disappointed.

"Not after your introduction," Valerius answered, finally standing up.
He gestured for the young Veela to disappear and approached the wolf still on the ground.
Jack stood in front of her, facing the vampire, who simply smiled once more.

"I do not want a war, wolf," the vampire groaned, "don't show your teeth."

The wording was a boon that Vladmir could not miss.
He calmly stepped forwared, imediately catching the attention of all the Magical Creatures in the room.

"We would like you to offer us one of your guests as a mark of good faith," he declared without raising his voice.

"My good faith?"

"As a proof of your sincerity."

"The beings present in my domain asked me for asylum," the vampire countered, using one of the main tacit rules among Magical Creatures.
The Right of Asylum one one of those main laws that had saved many creatures during the centuries of hunt.

"Those laws do not apply to humans.
And as far as we know, Albus Dumbledore is humain."

"Dumbledore…
What do you care about the leader of the Light?"

"If he was as "light" as he claimed, he would never have fled, and especially tried to kill Vladmir here."

"He is one of the rare wizards take the Magical Creatures' side."

"don't tell me you believe this?" Sergei sniggered.

"This man," Jack spat out, "is responsible for at least half of all the laws repressing Magical Creatures passed those last fifty years."

Valerius observed the murderous eyes of the werewolf, then Vladmir's glacial ones.
For the first time, he really payed attention to the people that accompanied them.
Sergei's young vampire looked familiar, but he could not remember the name.
Riper's female had a sharp tongue, as for the Kemenov's human, he was a mere guard.
But something united the six beings in front of him.
Thye all thought Dumbledore was guilty.
Were they right?
Was he really so bad?
The mas was wharismatic, quite different from what he had seen before, and inspired a blind faith.
Was he mistaken?

"Come on, Valerius, I am sure you do not want to face an alliance comprising clans Kemenov and Pokhastovine, the Riper pack, and the Five Families," Sergei declared softly.
"Give us Dumbledore.
We all have unfinished business with him."

The thousand-year-old vampire spat loudly, smile and friendliness  gone.
Despire himself, Vladmir could only find the vampire terrifying.
Hiding his fear under his experessionless mask, the young Russian observed, fascinated, as Sergei, with a smug smile, faced the clearly furious Valerius.

"You dare threaten me in my own domain?" the Primate of England roared.

"I dare.
Do I need to remind you who won last time?"

Vladmir barely had time to make Anton stand back and raise a powerful magical shield before Valerius threw himself at Sergei.
The impact of the two vmapires against the wall made it collapse.
Responding to the sudden attack by their Master, the vampires present in the room started to attack the other guests and the young Russian extended his physical shield over the two lycanthropes, using Dark Magic and his own blood to strengthen it and make it unbreakable.

Only the shield was protecting them, as Vlad's blood fed it.
Anton, who was also maintaining a shield against magical attacks, looked at the blood flow.

**"Take my blood, we need to hold until Sergei beats him,"** Anton whispered, reaching out with his palm to Vlad.
**"I will handle the loss of blood better, thanks to my stature."**

The Russian looked into his guard's green eyes, and he could only agree.
Between his own 45 kilograms and Anton's 100 kilograms, the latter could lose more blood than himself without so many adverse effects.
He pointed his wand to the outstretched hand and a cut appeared, making blood flow.

sheltered under the two combined shields, they could only wait for the end of the combat, hoping they would hold.
Vladmir and Antont knew perfectly well that they would not be able to fight a dozen vampires, especially since the others would come quickly, attracted by the combat noises.

"Sergei is leading the fight," Jack declared calmly, who was fuming to have to stay put while there was a good fight in front of him.
Contrary to the two humans, werewolves could easily follow the blows quite easily.
Jack was looking attentively, and Mattie was astounded.
To see vampires fight was not a pretty spectacle, even for a race know for their savagery.
Sergei was undoubtedly dominating his enemy, letting him tire by just evading and parrying the claw and bite attacks.
Valerius's attacks were sly, brutal, and murderous, and Sergei was calmly waiting for an opening in the defence of the England Primate.

It presented itself quite quickly.
Infuriated when he could not touch his opponent, the thousand-year-old vampire started to lose patience and focus.
Sergei, using vampiric movements, slipped under his guard and clawed into Valerius's exposed belly.
With a sickening succion noise, he pushed into is innards, looking for his blood stomach, the oran that allowed them to filter the different elements present in the fluids vampires drank.

He nearly immediately found it and lacerated it without a qualm, making Valerius scream stidently, as the injured vmapire was desperately trying to claw at Sergei's neck.
However, the latter was standing behind him, vampire vital parts, neck and belly, now unreachable thanks to his free hand.
Ignoring Valerius's claws that were exposing the bones in his arms, he plunged his head into the neck of the Primate of England, and started to suck his blood.

Immediately, the vampires around them, who were attacking Vladmir's and Anton's shields, froze and carefully looked at the scene.
Sergei only released Valerius when he practically drew all his blood, and the thousand-year-old vampire collapsed to the ground like a doll.

"Master!"

Sergei caughe the young Veela as she rushed towards him, and observed the woman turn into a screaming harpy, as she was struggling to get to the vampire on the ground.
Veela was stunning women, but they were outright ugly when upset or afraid.

"Shut up, or he will die," Sergei ordered.

The Veela immediately calmed down, getting back her soft and delicate appearance, and Vladmir let his shield fall to approach Sergei, attentively glancing at his friend and chief security officer's gashed right arm.
He knew perfectly well that with Valerius defeated, none of his vampires would hurt him without Sergei's permission.

"Where is Dumbledore?" Vladmir asked, without getting too close to Valerius.
Which had been a great idea, because the vampire whistled and tried to attack him.
However, he was so injured that Sergei, still holding a Veela, managed to stop him.
In one movement, he ripped the arm that tried to strangle Vlad and threw it in the flames.

"You will die if you don't answer me, Valeris," the young Russian declared coldly.
"Sergei is not very patient with you, and I am not sure he would care to finish you off, in front of your mistress."

"Go to hell, Kemenov!" Valerius spat out, while the Veela was struggling again in Sergei's arm, his blood staining her splendid blue dress.
However, his wounds were nearly gine, the blood he had injested allowing him to quickly regenerate.

"I already went through it," Vlad smiled softly, taking a knife out.
"However, are you ready to go there?
You already lost one arm, your stomach is in shambles, and if you take too long, no one will be able to save you, not even your Veela's magical blood.
Your men will not save you while Sergei does not give them the order, and you will die like a siren out of water.
Where is Dumbeldore?"

"In…" the man started before spitting out blood.
Even if breathing was nearly inexistant in vampires, they still needed lungs to talk.
Zfter all, vocal chors worked thanks to movements of air, and Sergei's claws probably messed up more than just his digestive tract.

"_Anapneo_," Vladmir whispered to clear the bronchial tubes that were blocked by blood.
Valerius inhaled with difficulty.

"He is in Hawkstone Hall, in Derbyshire."

Sergei released the Veela, who rushed to Valerius, ready to give her blood to try and save him.
At the last moment, Nikolai caught her and looked dagger at Valerius.

"Promise that your or your clan will not try to attack the Knyaz Pokhastovine again, nor Riper's pack," the former Emperor of Russia said coldly.

"I promise," Valerius said panifully.
"On my sould, neither me nor my vampires will attack the Knyaz Pokhastivine or his clan ever again.
I also vow that neither me nor my vampires will hurt the Riper pack, as long as they don't attack us."

Jack thought that the idea that his own could attack vampires without a good reason was insulting, but her forced himself to stay silent, and made Mattie shut up, who was as offended.

"Your oath that there is no _Fideliusè_ Charm or other magical barries on the Hawkstone Hall domain," Vladmir declared in turn, getting an upset look from Valerius.

"My… my ring…" he eventually said gesturing to a golden ring that was shining on is finger.

Sergei approached and took out the ring, which was minted with the shield of Valerius's clan.
He immediately felt all the magic in it and he smiled to Vladmir at his excellent intuition.
With this ring, they could access all the domains of the clan in England.
It was a true pass he had given them.

"Get… her…"

**"Release her,"** Sergei ordered, gesturing to the woman in the former Emperor's arms.

Nikolai freed the crying Veela, who rushed to her Master.
As Valerius was avidly biting into the young woman's thin wrist, the six 'guests' quickly walked away, only to face dozens of vampires.
Whether because of the news of Sergei's victory on their Master, or the ring that the Russian Vampire was wearing, the night creatures slowly moved away from their path, some smiling, somme gloomy.
Valerius would certainly have to face rebellion in their ranks for decades, but it was not theirs to face.
And they had held their promise to Jack by weakening Valerius.

"Well, let's go to Derbyshir," Sergei sighed.

"We're coming with you," Jack declared.

**"I'm getting Lady Kemenov and Lord Malfoy,"** Anton declared, who had not talked much since the beginning of their mission.

**"Stay in Malfoy manor,"** Vladmir ordered.
**"You lost a lot of blood."**

**"Yes, your Highness."**

Anton bowed down and disappeared with a crack, the werewolves looking suspiciously.

"Where did he go?"

"To get reinforcements," Sergei declared calmly.

And what quality reinforcement…
Anton had not only told the two targets but also Severus Prince and Augusta must be present, because they also arrived… all hidden under their Triad cloaks.

Jack was the first one to figure out the four people in fring of them, who wore the impressive grey cloaks of the Mirage Court.
The gold, red, and silver trims were quite meaningful, but the impressive coat of arms on their back made him open his eyes wide.

"Merlin…
You are…"

"The _Underground_'s Triad," the one Vladmir knew was Augusta, easily recongnisable thanks to her stature, agreed softly.
The Longbottom matriarch was the smallest of them four.
The voices were always changed for safety reasons, but without it, he would have recognised her thanks to the red trim on her cloak the, as the _Underground_'s mistress of poisons and specialist of direct assassinations.
Severus and Lucius had the exact same body type, but thankfully the first one, as Potions Master, was a Fence, with his golden trim, while Lucius was a Politician.

"Why is the Russian Court also present?" Jack asked feebly.

"Reasons internal to the Court," Katya answered atonely while around them dozens of wizards appeared, unsurprisingly wearing the same cloak.
Triads never made a public appearence without an escort.

"Vladmir Vassilievtich Kemenov.
Because of your status as a Hogwarts student, we request you go back to your home."

Vlamdir opened his eyes wide and wanted to protest, but his aunt stopped him.

**"It's an order, Vladmir!
Riper needs not know you are one of us, and no one must suspect you have strong links with the Mirage Court.
It's the first public appearance of the _Underground_ in twenty years, it's going to make people talk, and you must not be associated with it!"**

Vladmir could only agree, and he went back to Malfoy manor with a heavy heart.
Despite his friends' worry, he stayed silent all evening, and he did not sleep much.
He was impatiently awaiting news of the hunt, and Lucius only appeared early in the morning, tired and injured, while the Alliance was still sleeping.

"What happened?" Vladmir asked slowly, surprised and worried to see him come back alone.

"He ran away," Lucius flatly declared, summoning a dozen poitons he drank one after the other, grimacing at their horrendous taste.
Vladmit waited silently for the first ones to have some effect, noting that some injuries seemed pretty bad.

"He had an ally.
A powerful, Dark Mage, ally," Lucius continued.

"Voldemort?" Vladmir hissed.

"No, it was not is magical signature.
Katya has a lead, but she did not want to tell me.
She seemed quite worried.
Enough to ask Rasputin to spent a few days here to talk with you and Prasvoskia."

Lucius brushed his forehead wearily, spreading blood on several blond strands, then he rummaged in a pocket to take a parchment whose wax seal had disappeared.

"By the way, an owl delivered this yesterday.
Katya took the liverty to open it," the Lord said, handing him the piece of paper.

"What is it?" Vlamdir asked, carefully observing the man's experessions, whose lips were now a simple line on his face.

"An invitation byt the Minister for Magic to the opening ceremony to the World Cup, one week from now."

"Invitations to children are usually associated to the ones to their parents," Vlamdir said, furrowing his brow.

"Indeed, bit Katya is not invited.
Only yourself as Prince Potter."

"What about the others?"

"They are, but you have a specific invitation, to the Minister's table, where the others are not invited.

Vlamdir squinted his eyes and wondered if he was mistaken about the Minister for Magic.
Maybe he was not that much of an idiot…
