## Chapter 26: Second victim

Vladmir and Neville attentively looked at Severus Snape's face, and especially the quite impressive array of emotions his face and eyes expressed.

Those numerous expressions were pretty surprising, coming from the most stoic man the Kemenov heir knew.
The Profeessor passed through genuine surprise, to curiosity, to anger, to finally settle on denial.

Vladmir did not find this sequence surprising in itself.
Not after what he had learned about that man.

The Potions Master had been one of the first people who caught his attention, along with Neville and Quirell, especially because of his partial and heinous behaviour against him.
But contrary to the other two, Vlad had not asked his aunt about him, and she had not either apart from the basic research Katya always did on anyone interacting with her nephew...

The young Kmenov heir had hurriedly caught up to his monumental error.
Katya had been astounded by those discoveries, and she had made herself understood in a letter that accompanied the data she had gather on the Potions Master.
They had all missed Snape's real identity, and it was unacceptable for the Five Families.

What he had discovered was definitely surprising.
Thanks to their contacts with Goblins, the Kemenovs had learned about his estate-- it was impressive what you could learn from a few numbers--, as well as his familial and judicial background, thanks to Amelia Bones, who happily answered their inquiry.

Severus Snape, as heir to the Price family, had quite modestly filled vaults compared to his maternal line's wealth.
He was far from poor: numerous royalties from the potions he had created and his income as a Hogwarts professor amounted to a sizeable savings account.
However, it could not be compared to the amount contained in the vaults belonging to the antique Prince line.
The coffers and assets had not been touched since Adrius Prince's death, Snape's grandfather, except for a payment that probably came from a will.
As if the man never knew about his wealth.
Vladmir could tell from his reactions that he did not.

The second discovery was that Snape belonged to the Death Eater movement.
He was also one of Voldemort's seconds in command, his Inner Circle, which housed the most fanatical and dangerous Death Eaters.
The man's trial at the Dark Lord's fall had revealed his role as a spy for Albus Dumbledore, and he had been pardonned for it.
Thanks to their talk with Lucius Malfoy, Katya and Vlad knew that his entry into the Death Eaters was volontary, based on a need for recognition a Prince should never have needed.

The familial background the Kemenov matriarch had managed to assemble explained a big part of this need.
He had been raised by a father who hated magic and a mother who was weaked by mistreatment before dying prematurely.
In the dossier she had sent Vlad, Katya hypothesised that he had been belittled his whole childhoow.
His entry into Slythrin, mere Half-Blood among Pure-Bloods during Voldemort's rise to power, did not help that bit.

Vlad regretfully observed the man in front of him.
No pity, just regret.
Nobody informed Severus Snape of the prestige his family had because of a number of ridiculous factors.
His typically Muggle name never pushed is Housemates to ask about his mother's line, and Pure-Bloods never used their time to tell him about the traditional stories of the magical world.

"You're probably mistaken," Snape finally grumbled, finally getting back a neutral face.
"I may be a Prince, but I am not Arthur's descendant!"

"You doubt my words."

Vladmir simply noted a fact he had expected to note since the beginning.
He looked at Neville to find some support, but sighed.
The Gryffindor was leaning on his chair's back, symbolically marking he as a mere spectator in his discussion, happy to learn secrets he should never have been privy to.

The Five Families are the Bones, Notts, Potters, Princes, and Rowles.
I doubt Theodore and Susan know, but Theodore Sr. and Amelia Bones have to know the name of the chief line.
A Death Eater and the Head of the Department of Magical Law Enforcement.
If both tell you, will you believe them?
I think Gwenelle Rowle will tell her children the truth when they are of age," Vladmir pensively continued.
"Ask the three families, they will cite your name."

"I have nothing of a Prince," Severus stubbornly responded.

The young Russian sighed deeply, then asked for tea from a House Elf.
A few second later, three hot cups of tea appeared in front of them, served by Neville who claimed he wanted to do something more than just listening.
The Potions Master quickly mimicked his students and drank a gulp after he had enjoyed the aroma.
His tense body immediately relaxed, as his traits visibly appeased.

"I did not see anything, and I was watching you...
But you managed to slip a calming potion in my cup," the Head of Slytherin noted softly.

"I am the heir to the _Underground_'s Master Assassin Family, I sure hope I am able to drug any drink without getting caught," Neville sarcastically ansered, as Vlad let a sneer appear on his face from seeing the Professor out of words at Neville's wit.
Indeed, the gap between his public and private sleves was large, and the chage could be unsettling for the uninitiated...

"I am used to seeing masks on my House's students, Mr. Longbottom, not on Minerva's," Severus slowly said, sipping his tea again.

"You should have suspected it, knowing his family," Vladmir pointed out.

"I have truly lacked discernment, and did not think an eleven-year-old child would be ready to play a public role," the Professor admitted, before sighing deeply.
"I am not princely..."

"That's not up to you to decide," Neville declared, forwning.
"Mordred was not princely, and yet he was Arthur's son, and the first heir.3

"Are you comparing me to the Great Traitor?" Severus asked with a dulcet voice, looking dagger at the young Gryffindor who, if they had been in class, would have feigned distress.
Except they were not in class, and he answered by a sneer.

"In a way, you are the Traitor of our time," he said, referencing his work as a spy for both sides during the war.
"And Mordred was Arthur's only son.
He is your ancestor."

"Neville is right, Professor.
You are the legitimate heir, and should you claim the title, the Four Families will follow you.
Howver, your status as heir is deeper, linked to Ancient magic."

"I am not sure I understand.
Ancient magic, like the one Merlin and the Knight-Mages of the Round Table used?
The one that did not come from mastery of our magical core, but the mastery over the ambient magic?"

The few things Snape knew about Ancient magic came from his readings.
Its usage nearly disappeard, as wizards considered it demeaning, because House Elfs used it, among other beings.
They took their magic from the objects around them, the air, and the wizards...

"Exactly," Vladmir nodded.
"Magica families using this form of magic are rare nowadays, contrary to all magical creatures, but..."

Vladmir turned his emeral green gaze towards his friend who was sipping his tea, listening intently to the conversation between the legitimate heir to the English magical kingdom, and the boy who who probably be one of his closest servants.
Neville was convinced that Vladmir would efficiently support Severus Snape if the latter decided to claim the throne.
The Five Families only were eleven members in total, the most influential ones in the magical society.
Among them were Katya Kemenov, Amelia Bones, and Lorn Rowle, leader of one of the three biggest political blocks in the International Confederation of Wizards.

"Vlad, whatever you say," Neville eventually said," I already swore I would not reveal anything.
However, I'd advise you to start with the big picture.
Professor Snape seems quite lost...
Even if he hides it remarkably well."

Severus pinched his nose, sighing.
He nearly regretted the Longbottom he knew from the lectures.
He was easier to understand and redict.
Although he would not refuse a summary.
How did he end up in this situation?
Him, heir to the ancient magical kingdom?

"You are in this situation because somebody hid the truth from you," Vladmir declared with a glacial voice, while the Potions Master realised that he spoke out loud.

Indeed, someone hid the truth from him.
Someone who deliberately isolated him from the other lines.
Someone Vlad knew too well, and who shamelessly used his position once more.
The question was to know exactely what the old nosey mage knew...

"I would like you to explain everything, from the Five Familes to Ancient magic..."

Vladmir nodded to Snape's legitimate request, and he comfortably settled down.
He could rage at Albus Dumbledre later, for now, he had to do what his aunt did for him a few years earlier...
Recounting the history of the Five Families.

"I will say you the Gest.
I it is the history of our families, the reason for our heirlooms, the way it was said to me," Vladmir whispered.

> Listen son, listen to the history of our country.
> In the dawn of Magic, a Wizard King, Arthur, was born, lived, died.
> His gest is not the core of our history, but his heirloom.
>
> In the dawn of Magic, when faes and wizards mixed with pure beings, Artus was born, son of Uther and Ygern.
> Although illegitimated, Artus was destined to rule both the pure beings' world, and the migical beings' world.
> Born from two royal lines, this powerful, loyal and just man inherited his father's burden and nobly ruled the kingdom.
> Initiated to the Magical Arcanes by Merwytt, he became the Wizard-King who made him famous, and he led his Court of knights around the Round Table.
> Artus gather around him brave warriors, as well as Kight-Mages, members of the oldest order of wizard warriors, in Perceval, Galahad, Gawain, and Tristan.
> Later Mordred joined, his son and heir.
>
> Artus thus governed, just and kind.
> However, the prosperity of his kingdom brought envy, and he had to fight for the peace of his kingdom.
> Until the fateful battle of Camlann.
> Artus, mortally wounded, was accompanied to Avalon by his Knight-Mages and his son.
> He was led to Morgan and Vivian, guardians of the Sacred Island.
> THe two powerful witches supported him the day before his death, and Artus let out his last breath of Magic at dawn.

"Morgan is responsible for Arthur's fall with Mordred, that's was History says," Severus suddenly noted, perplexed by Vladmir's account that differed so much from what they were taught in Hogwarts and in books.

"History is written by winners," the Russian softly said.
"Officially Arthur was not a wizard, Morgan was a Dark witch, and Mordred was the traitor who mortally wounded his father in Calmann."

"All the old families know that that that time, no distinction was maed between Dark Magic and Light Magic, because sacrifice, which initially defined Dark Magic, were common practice," Neville intervened.
"Ancient magic was based on surrounding energy, in the air, the ground, in other living beings, plants, animals..."

The young Longbottom was starting to understand Severus Snape's real problem, as connections were starting to form between rumours and reality.
The entire school was convienced that the Potions Master was a Pure-Blodd; after all, he was a known Death Eater, with manners worthy of the highest families.
But the truth was different.
Neville was discovering large gaps in his knowledge of magical traditions, the ones that were only transmitted orally, the ones that brought the children to sleep.
Those gaps convinced him that Snape was a Half-Blood raised in a mainly Muggle environment.

"Mordred was indeed Arthur's and his half-sister Morgan's son.
However, his father acknowledged him at his birth and raised him as his heir
Mordred was never a traitor, because he spied for his father by playing the role of the heinous son in the enemy side.
Morgan was the Secret Keeper of Avaln Island, one of the oldest magical cities in the world.

Severus saied silent, harshly taking in the news.
Vladmir let him digest it for a few minutes, during which Neville served some more tea.
Then Vlamdir continued his recounting.

> The King died at dawn and was buried in the land of Magic.
> Vivian, the Lady of the Lake, then entered a transe and a prophecy was told on the tomb of the Wizard-King.
>
> When the Heir and the Spy mingle again,
>
> When the past and the future in one blood fuse,
>
> The the Darkness on our world will spread,
>
> Tragedy will strike the Heirs and around the Prince, they will gather.
>
> Gawainanf Galahad will be dual, the matriarchs watching over them.
>
> Tristan and Percival will conflict, good against evil, Darkness against Light.
>
> Tragedy will strike the Heirs, and around the Prince, they will gather.
>
> Around the Prince, the Heirs will gather, and Magic will Awaken.
>
> The prophecy, dark and announcing hard times, was hidden, and the mourning of the Wizard-King began.
> Lancelot, traitor to the Crown, took advantage of the King's death and usurped the throne, marrying the newly-widowed Queen to strenghen his power.
> In Avalon, the royal line dwelt to stay safe, and the four Knight-Mages settled around them, powerful protectors of the magical city.
>
> All had descendants, and slowly the heirloom of these families passed into legend, protecting the Avalon princes from envy the prestige aroung Artus's name brought.
>
> Time passed, and the Magical Kingdom disappeared, evolving with magical society and the non-magical world.
> Roles changed and the heir became the keeper of Avalon and ancient magic, living symbol of Magia.
>
> Names and appearances changed, hiding the heirs in the crowd.
> Only the ancient lines remembered the names of the Five Families and the secret they protected, and the prophecy was forgotten by all.


"The goal of our families is to maitain ancien magic.
The Magical Kingdom is but secondary," Vladmir sighed.

"How do you know all that?"

"Pardon me?" Vlad asked, surprised.

"How do you know all that?
You never knew your father, and if I understood correctly, parents are the one transmitting those stories..."

"Before anything else, those are not stories, but historical facts," the young Russian sighed again.
"Then again, Katya is a Potter.
My grandfather told her the prophecy when she was a child, and she told me on my tenth birthday, when she thought I would be able to understand the whys and wherefores of everything."

"Why Dumbledore..."

"I don't know," Vladmir whsipered.
"He probably does not know this in detail.
If he knows, then I don't understand the point in pushing you away from your inheritance and the place you have in our society.
I will look into it, but I don't think I will like what I will find..."

"I will do the same," Snape said under his breath, his eyes shining threateningly.
Severus Snape was a former member of the _Underground_ after all, and as with all people afficliated with the Courts, he was dangerous, which Neville seemed to have forgotten...

"Be carfeul not to rise suspicion," the Gryffindor softly warned as he put down his cup of tea.

"Mr. Longbottom, you seem to forget that my first employment is not as a Potions professor.
I am a spy and a potionnist for the Mirage Court," the man snickered, which made his students, and now accomplices, smile in response.

"If you learn anything, could you please keep us informed?" Neville asked.

Snape's look said it all, and Vladmir gave him a sombre smile.

"Don't do anything reckless, anyway."

"For Slytherins, revenge is a dish best served freezing cold, Mr. Kemenov.
I think you can get back to you dormitories before the curfew, gentlement.

The two studens were surprised that Snape did not try to learn more about their little group and the strange friendship they shared.
In fact, the Potions professor would have liked to learn more.
After all, he had noticed potentially disturbing details.
Lokhart's obvious fear of Kevin Enthistle and Vladmir Kemenov.
The aura typically linked to Dark Magic that was starting to appear around Neville Longbottom.
The strange, luminous halo around Hermione Granger.
The too numerous Unbreakable Vows he saw on Longbottom's arms...
Neville's affiliation to the _Underground_...

However, the Potions professor had too much to think about those revelations, and his students made the most of it to quickly leave, leaving Severus Snape to his thoughts.
Vlamdir, as the door closed on the man alone in his office, thought about helping Snape with his research.
What better ally and spy that a man already close to the Headmaster?

"I'm going to the Common Room," Neville sighed, interrupting his thoughts.
"I have to talk to the twins."

"If they need materials, have them come tomorrow with a list," Vlad said, not asking for information.
Neville had his secrets, and he would tell him if there was a problem.

They parted ways, and Vladmir went to Ravenclaw's Common Room, passing by students from other Houses.
He distractedly gave the answer to the traditional riddle from the painting guarding the Eagle House, and went in the Room.
The warm part was empty, but numerous heads were visible in the study room.
All were serious, bent over homework, and Vlad smiled while walking to his room.

Vlad had just reached his door when he froze.
He perked up his ears, frowning, and took his wand out of his holster.
Voices came through the door, voices not belonging to Kevin, but that he knew.
One was Sasha, with her hissing accent, but he could not put a face on the ather one.

He slowly opened the door and immediately relaxed, warmly smiling at his surprise guest, realising he definitely would not be able to put a face on that husky voice.
In the middle of his bed, André, Sorting Hat by trade, was talking without any communication problem with Sasha, Fawkes sleeping nearby.

_"I told you he'd be here soon,"_ the small viper said.

_"The one time I don't bring you to my lessons, you find the way to talk?"_ the Russian aksed amusingly.

_"André has very interesting anecdotes about the castle,"_ the snake explained.
_"for once, I can talk to someone other that you and Kevin!
He wants to talk to you."_

"I had a feeling that you you need me rather quickly, young Kemenov," Adree nodded, "so here I am."

"Indeed..."

Vlamdir quickly explained to him the evolution of the last few months, as well as what he expected of him, before requesting his presence two days later in the Alliance Headquarters.
André promissed he would come, and disappeared with Fawkes in a fireball.

<hr>

The next days passed quickly, between the lessons, Draco's Quidditch training, the fruitless research on the Chamber of Secrets and the Basilisk, the Weasley twins' worry about their young sister, and a Severus Snape absent 'for medical reasons', according to the Headmaster.

In short, the week had been eventful, but the small group was now in the Ravenclaw stand to follow the first match of the Quidditch season, Slytherin v. Gryffindor.

"Hey Vlad, Professor Snape is back!" Hermione declared, pointing to the professor's tribune.

Indeed, the Potions Master was back, but not alone.
Sitting next to him was Lucius Malfoy, proud and arrogant.

"What is Malfoy doing there?" Kevin asked, surprised.

"I think he wants to see Draco play, and as a Governor, he has a right to be present if he so wishes," Hermione answered distractedly, focused on the players' entry.

"Still as lovely as ever beteen Flint and Wood", Neville jokingly noted when the two captains shook, or rather crunshed, their hands, which was visible even at their distance.

Then they got caught up in the game, admiring the teamwork of the Slytherin team and encouraging their friends.
Like the previous year, the Slytherin were reactive and tested the limits of cheating, while the Gryffindors stayed solid, working simple but efficient strategies.

Draco seemed quite good and was for now circling above the pitch with Noemi Landburn, Gryffindor's Seeker, loking for the Snitch.
Until he had to avoid a homing Bludger.

"It's not normal," Vladmir whispered, as concerned cries rose up from the Hufflepuff stands.
They were not the only ones that noticed the Bludger's harrasment of Draco.
For a few minutes, the two Beaters defended their Seeker as much as they could, then Flint requested a time out, under the boos from the Gryffindors.

"Do you think it's jinxed?" Kevin asked softly, leaning towards Vladmir, as discussion between Mrs. Hooch, the referee, and Marcus Flint were lively.

"Confident."

"What's the point of targetting Draco?" Hermione asked.

"No idea, but I hope he knows what he is doing."

Draco had just gestured appeasingly towards them, a gesture they had chose a few months before, when they could not openly reassure each other in case of a problem.

"Malfoy Sr. and Snape are fuming."

"Obviously... Blimeny, that Bludger is not letting him go!"

Laughter rose from the stands, quasi exclusively from the Gryffindors, as Draco made increasingly dangerous manoeuvres to avoid the ball, while still looking for the Snitch.
Slytherins stayed immobile, eyes fixed on their young Seeker, white as a sheet from the stress, while Ravenclaws and Hufflepuffs were openly worrying.

The match continued, Gryffindor taking advantage of their opponent's distraction.
Until Draco charged towards the other Seeker.

"He saw the Snitch", Neville noted.

"Where?" Kevin asked.

"Behind Landburn," Vlad answered.

Indeed, the small ball was flying behind the lioness, who lokked in fear as the Slytherin was flying towards her, followed by the Bludger.
She did not try to find it, and fled at the moment where Draco caught the Snitch.
At the same time, the rogue Bludger violently hit his arm, unbalancing the young Malfoy.
Draco was ejected from his broom, and fell for a few meters before painfully landing on a sand bunker.

His friends had reacted before he his the ground.
They were the first ones to jump over the railing to get to the ground, using magic to descend the three meters of the stands, as the professors barely realised how grave the accident really was.

"Draco, be careful!" Hermione yelled, using a _sonorus_, as the Bludger was flying quickly towards the Slytherin on the ground.
The young Seeker immediately understood the danger, and rolled on the ground, avoiding several dangerous impacts, until the Weazleys twins, the players closest to him, simultaneously hit the Bludger with their bats to get it away.

"Go away Malfoy! It's targetting you!" Fred yelled as the ball was immediately flying back.

Flint arrived right then and raised his player, installing him behind him despite Draco's painful groan.
He immediately flew towards the stand, while the Slytherin beaters also intervened, helping the twins
