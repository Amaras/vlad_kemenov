## Chapter 25: Second victim

Vladmir and Neville attentively looked at Severus Snape's face, and especially the quite impressive array of emotions his face and eyes expressed.

Those numerous expressions were pretty surprising, coming from the most stoic man the Kemenov heir knew.
The Profeessor passed through genuine surprise, to curiosity, to anger, to finally settle on denial.

Vladmir did not find this sequence surprising in itself.
Not after what he had learned about that man.

The Potions Master had been one of the first people who caught his attention, along with Neville and Quirell, especially because of his partial and heinous behaviour against him.
But contrary to the other two, Vlad had not asked his aunt about him, and she had not either apart from the basic research Katya always did on anyone interacting with her nephew...

The young Kmenov heir had hurriedly caught up to his monumental error.
Katya had been astounded by those discoveries, and she had made herself understood in a letter that accompanied the data she had gather on the Potions Master.
They had all missed Snape's real identity, and it was unacceptable for the Five Families.

What he had discovered was definitely surprising.
Thanks to their contacts with Goblins, the Kemenovs had learned about his estate-- it was impressive what you could learn from a few numbers--, as well as his familial and judicial background, thanks to Amelia Bones, who happily answered their inquiry.

Severus Snape, as heir to the Price family, had quite modestly filled vaults compared to his maternal line's wealth.
He was far from poor: numerous royalties from the potions he had created and his income as a Hogwarts professor amounted to a sizeable savings account.
However, it could not be compared to the amount contained in the vaults belonging to the antique Prince line.
The coffers and assets had not been touched since Adrius Prince's death, Snape's grandfather, except for a payment that probably came from a will.
As if the man never knew about his wealth.
Vladmir could tell from his reactions that he did not.

The second discovery was that Snape belonged to the Death Eater movement.
He was also one of Voldemort's seconds in command, his Inner Circle, which housed the most fanatical and dangerous Death Eaters.
The man's trial at the Dark Lord's fall had revealed his role as a spy for Albus Dumbledore, and he had been pardonned for it.
Thanks to their talk with Lucius Malfoy, Katya and Vlad knew that his entry into the Death Eaters was volontary, based on a need for recognition a Prince should never have needed.

The familial background the Kemenov matriarch had managed to assemble explained a big part of this need.
He had been raised by a father who hated magic and a mother who was weaked by mistreatment before dying prematurely.
In the dossier she had sent Vlad, Katya hypothesised that he had been belittled his whole childhoow.
His entry into Slythrin, mere Half-Blood among Pure-Bloods during Voldemort's rise to power, did not help that bit.

Vlad regretfully observed the man in front of him.
No pity, just regret.
Nobody informed Severus Snape of the prestige his family had because of a number of ridiculous factors.
His typically Muggle name never pushed is Housemates to ask about his mother's line, and Pure-Bloods never used their time to tell him about the traditional stories of the magical world.

"You're probably mistaken," Snape finally grumbled, finally getting back a neutral face.
"I may be a Prince, but I am not Arthur's descendant!"

"You doubt my words."

Vladmir simply noted a fact he had expected to note since the beginning.
He looked at Neville to find some support, but sighed.
The Gryffindor was leaning on his chair's back, symbolically marking he as a mere spectator in his discussion, happy to learn secrets he should never have been privy to.

The Five Families are the Bones, Notts, Potters, Princes, and Rowles.
I doubt Theodore and Susan know, but Theodore Sr. and Amelia Bones have to know the name of the chief line.
A Death Eater and the Head of the Department of Magical Law Enforcement.
If both tell you, will you believe them?
I think Gwenelle Rowle will tell her children the truth when they are of age," Vladmir pensively continued.
"Ask the three families, they will cite your name."

"I have nothing of a Prince," Severus stubbornly responded.

The young Russian sighed deeply, then asked for tea from a House Elf.
A few second later, three hot cups of tea appeared in front of them, served by Neville who claimed he wanted to do something more than just listening.
The Potions Master quickly mimicked his students and drank a gulp after he had enjoyed the aroma.
His tense body immediately relaxed, as his traits visibly appeased.

"I did not see anything, and I was watching you...
But you managed to slip a calming potion in my cup," the Head of Slytherin noted softly.

"I am the heir to the _Underground_'s Master Assassin Family, I sure hope I am able to drug any drink without getting caught," Neville sarcastically ansered, as Vlad let a sneer appear on his face from seeing the Professor out of words at Neville's wit.
Indeed, the gap between his public and private sleves was large, and the chage could be unsettling for the uninitiated...

"I am used to seeing masks on my House's students, Mr. Longbottom, not on Minerva's," Severus slowly said, sipping his tea again.

"You should have suspected it, knowing his family," Vladmir pointed out.

"I have truly lacked discernment, and did not think an eleven-year-old child would be ready to play a public role," the Professor admitted, before sighing deeply.
"I am not princely..."

"That's not up to you to decide," Neville declared, forwning.
"Mordred was not princely, and yet he was Arthur's son, and the first heir.3

"Are you comparing me to the Great Traitor?" Severus asked with a dulcet voice, looking dagger at the young Gryffindor who, if they had been in class, would have feigned distress.
Except they were not in class, and he answered by a sneer.
