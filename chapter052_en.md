# Chapter 52: facing your fears

Vlad was still not out of the Hospital Wing, and he was starting to get bored, after only a day.
He hated to stay immobile and did nothing of his days, his nights were short.
At three in the morning, he was thus perfectly awake and alert, ruminating against Pomfrey's alarm spells that prevented him from even leaving his bed.
The Matron had ended up putting them on after she had caught him three times right before he got to the door.

To spend the time, at three in the morning, Vladmir was thus reading several journals narrating both the Tri-Wizard Tournament and the Clan War, sniggering at the points of view.
While the Russian ones, especially the _Red Dawn_, were offended that a clan's matriarch and famous politician woudl be arrested for her participation in one of the oldest traditions in their society, the British ones were horrified that a woman could get away with murdering someone in the middle of Hogwarts.
The diplomatic relationships between the two countries were thus quite tense, and from what he understood, the Ministry for Magic, especially Lucius Malfoy as Minister and Damocles Rowle as Head of International Cooperation, were ripping their hair out.

**"Auntie, your future husband will end up bald before you get your hands on him,"** Vladmir chuckled, looking at the photo of a particularly exasperated Minister for Magic on the front page of the _Daily Prophet_.

**"You're talking to yourself now, Kitten?"**

**"Knock before you enter, Sergei,"** the young Russian answered without looking up.

Sergei had spent all day with him until recently.
He had to feed after he had fasted for the three days he spent at his ward's bedside, and he had thus slipped away to the Forbidden Forest.

**"How are you?"** Sergei asked carefully.

**"Fine."**

**"Vladmir Vassilievitch, don't try that with me,"** the vampire sighed while sitting on his bed.

**"Tired."**

Sergei understood.
The tiredness whis ward was struggling with was not physical, but mental.

**"You're a bit yong for that."**

**"The Horcrux in my head.
The Five Families.
The Clan wards.
And now Draco.
The Tri-Wizard Tournament.
Hermione and her memoires…"**

**"You are afraid.
For yourself and the others,"** Sergei explained softly.
**"It's normal, Vladmir."**

**"It's too much,"** Vladmir whined softly, wrapping his arms around his knees.

Sergei sighed and softly embraced the young man, putting his head over Vladmir's head.
In response, he put his arms around the vampire's waist and nestled against him.

They stayed silent for a long moment, then Vladmir started to talk softly.
So softly that Sergei, despite his supernatural hearing, had to prick up his ears.

**"Katya will marry Lucius at some point.
But… where will she live?
How could she take care of the clan if she lives in Britain?
He is Minister for Magic and…
I am so happy for her but…
I don't want her to go.
She is my only family Sergei…"** Vladmir sniffed.

The vmapire sighed, be stayed silent for a few more seconds, starting to carefully pet his ward's hair.

**"And who am I exactly?
A Potter, with the associated charges?
Serverus… Severus will be king…
I promoised my self, and the prophecies…
But he can't do it alone…
And the Five Fmailies, we will do everything to help him, reestablish the monarchy.
The British need to.
They need a monarch… but so many obstacles!
The old piece of shit and his friend, the Pure-Bloods…
Avalon to find…
And if being a Potter wasn't enough, I am a Kemenov…
I don't was the title of Tsesarevitch and I…
I cannot inherit from both the Potters and the Kemenovs…
It's impossible, even if Kevin can take care of the Potter assest with his Knight-Mage status, there still are the political charges…
And Hermione, she is a Licorine… so risky for her… she will need Draco and everyone's support when they other will learn about it…
And Neville… your grandson…
Why is it so complicated?
This fucking parasite…
Grigori will help me, but he doesn't know how to do it and…
I must kill the ectoplasm as well…
Everything because of another fucking prophecy…
I have killed enough for a lifetime…
Even if Voldy deserves it… she didn't deserve it… her eyes… Anna…"**

Sergei calmly listen to Vladmir's disorganized speech.
What he was talking about was not new to him.
He was carefully looking at the events in the young Kemenov heir's life, and often discussed the repercussion onf the young man's mental health with Katya.
Vladmir, sniffing into the vampire's shirt, finally fell asleep.

The vampire was busy livingly tucking him in when the door of the Hospital Wing opened.

Sergei looked daggers at the new arrival and put a hand on his lips.

"He's just fallen asleep," he whispered to Kevin.

The Ravenclaw nodded and sat down next to Sergei.

"Why are you here?" the vampire whispered, noticing the school robes quickly pulled over his pyjamas, his hair ruffled.
It was past four in the morning, but Vlad's friend's gaze was alter.

"I don't know," kevin replied honestly, distractedly rubbing his arm.
"I felt something was wring, and woke up with the feeling that I had to be here."

"Is that the arm with your tattoo?" Sergei asked.
"May I?"

Kevin nodded and let the vmapire carefuly look at the impressive tattoo that nearly fully covered his arm.
He was surprised at the level of detail on the Potter coat-of-arms on the Muggle-Born's skin.
Sergei took his time and eventually smiled.

"The links between a lord and his vassal aren't well known because they are pretty rare nowadays.
I think that the vassalage oath, combined with your friendship, made you not only the Knight-Mage of the Potters, but also their liegeman.
It is a title given to the right-hand man of a wizarding lord or lady and which used an old form of magic, even older than the one used by the vassalage oathes.

"So, as liegeman, I would have instinctively felt that something was wrong?" Kevin mumbled.

"Exactly."

"He's thinking about too much," the Ravenclaw sighed.
"I think that the clan war was the straw that broke the camel's back."

"Muggle saying?" Sergei asked with a small smile, even if what Kevin had just said worried him.

"Yes."

"He spilled all he had on his mind," the vampire admitted.

"You should talk about it with Katya," Kevin declared softly.
"I think he is terrified of being sidelined."

"Pardon?"

"He has nightmares," the Ravenclaw sighed.
"I think he feels excluded, and not really a Kemenov.
It is getting very serious between Katya and Lucius, he only sees her during the holidays…
He is worried about the moment when their relationship becomes official."

"What is this bullshit?" Sergei took offence.

Vladmir mumbled something in his sleep in response to Sergei's sudden yell.

"First… his blood links with the Kemenovs come from a blood adoption, he already feels partially excluded.
Second, if Katya has a son, or even adaughter, he loses any right to the succession.
Maybe, if she has a daughter, he will keep the Tsesarevitch title for machistic reasons, but in any case, he wouldn't be _Heretem_ Kemenov any more."

"But… he never wanted the title," Sergei was horrified.

"Maybe, but it is a tangible link with the Kemenovs," the Ravenclaw sighed.

"I… it's absurd," Sergei whispered.
"He never showed any fear or…"

"I think it's the whole thing, Sergei," Kevin explained.
"Too much at once…
He needs support from his family and… I think the hardest thing, even if it is not a conscious decision, is that every time he sees you or Katya, it's for clann matters, and not to spend time with him…"

"And in the office, with Draco…" Sergei was horrified once more.

"Draco became Katya's priority over himself.
Unconsciously, he felt rejected.
Add to that the Tri-Wizard Tournament, three dangerous wizards wanting him dead, the knowledge of having a mental parasite and a clan war that broke his mind, and you get uncertainy and irrational fears."
