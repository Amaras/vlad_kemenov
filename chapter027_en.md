## Chapter 27: things quicken

Vladmir could not help but laugh, despite the circumstances.
He had supplied the twins with a new time of wares, arrived in the morning by owl.
Hidden in the middle of sweets that he was receiving since the start of the year, a miniturized crate housed the hundred or so low-grade protection talismans that Fred and George had ordered.

The leaders of Hogwarts' contraband had indeed decided to diversify.
Fear made people become idiots, and the new attack on Colin Crivey had sowed panic in the schhol.
The two readheads made the most of this opportunity, and started their juju business.
To their credit, the talismans had real magical properties.
They of course did not say that you could find them in any magical markeplace for a few Sickles.
Fred and George were masters in the art of what Vladmir called lying by omission.

"Frankly, the twins are geniouses," Kevin laughed.

The five friends were calmly sitting on the first steps of the entry Hall, and kept watch for the twins.
This Saturday afternoon, numerous students and passed next to Fred and Georged...
They had to ensure no professor arrived...
Two Gryffindor girls were on duty in the Great Hall, and a friend of the gingers was in the opposite corridor.
He was called Lee Jorda and, in Vlad's point of view, could reveal to be interesting.
The young man was the twins' unofficially official accomplice since they met in first year, and they trusted him fully, contrary to the two unknown girls.

The Russain smile with satisfaction.
Indeed, Fred and George Weasley were the only ones who could sell jujus with this much markup in a wizarding school, in the middle of the entry hall, and right under Dumbledore's nose.
Their partnership was definitely profitable, for both parties.
Vlad simply had to look at his bank transcripts on his student account in Gringott's, or the new robes the twins wore.

"I know," he finally answered. "They're really good for contraband.

"They brother made a scene in the common room," Neville declared suddenly.

"Which one?"

"Percival.
Ronald followed suite, mostly because of jealousy."

"Why?"

"Well, since their business is so profitable, they bought new robes for they and Ginerva.
Percy wanted to know where the money came from, and Ron threw a tantrum, yelling that he also had a right to new clothes.
He does not care one bit about where the money comes from, as long as he can take advantage of it..."

"In both cases, it's not surprising.
Percy is a Prefect, and quite strict on rules, both the law, and Hogwarts' rules.
As for Ronald, he's just an idiot and has a cronic jealously problem," Draco noted.

"Why did they offer robes to Giverna?" Kevin asjed.
"Not that it bothers me, but it's surprising.
It's not their style to do something selflessly."

"They're trying to get her out of her own world, and make her tell where the journal is."

"That's what you call bribery," Draco sneered.

"It's taking too long," Vlad whispered.
"She's withering fast..."

Ginnny Weasley had gotten out the the Great Hall at this time, followed by Luna Lovegood.
If the redhead had been lively before coming to school, according to her brother, she was now pale, here skin near translucent.
It was not hard to see that she was lost weight and that the slightest effort was painful.

"And the professors never noticed a thing," Hermione groaned, as she looked anxiously at the girl's lifeless eyes.
"McGonagall came last evening, and she never looked at Ginny!"

"Did you try to talk to her?" kevin asked, looking at the pair moving through the hall.
Fred and George were also observing their sister while continuing business with a last year Hufflepuff.

"I did, and so did Neville.
She was so shy and fearfull that we prefered leaving her alone.
The thing with Colin did not help.
He was the only one, along with Lovegood, who could approach her.
They were always sitting together in class..."

"Luna seems worried as well."

The small blond Ravenclaw was carefully following her friend, babbling quickly.
While her attitude was as out there as usual, Luna's eyes were attentive for one.
She raised her head,
