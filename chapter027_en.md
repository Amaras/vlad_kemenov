## Chapter 27: things quicken

Vladmir could not help but laugh, despite the circumstances.
He had supplied the twins with a new time of wares, arrived in the morning by owl.
Hidden in the middle of sweets that he was receiving since the start of the year, a miniturized crate housed the hundred or so low-grade protection talismans that Fred and George had ordered.

The leaders of Hogwarts' contraband had indeed decided to diversify.
Fear made people become idiots, and the new attack on Colin Crivey had sowed panic in the schhol.
The two readheads made the most of this opportunity, and started their juju business.
To their credit, the talismans had real magical properties.
They of course did not say that you could find them in any magical markeplace for a few Sickles.
Fred and George were masters in the art of what Vladmir called lying by omission.

"Frankly, the twins are geniouses," Kevin laughed.

The five friends were calmly sitting on the first steps of the entry Hall, and kept watch for the twins.
This Saturday afternoon, numerous students and passed next to Fred and Georged...
They had to ensure no professor arrived...
Two Gryffindor girls were on duty in the Great Hall, and a friend of the gingers was in the opposite corridor.
He was called Lee Jorda and, in Vlad's point of view, could reveal to be interesting.
The young man was the twins' unofficially official accomplice since they met in first year, and they trusted him fully, contrary to the two unknown girls.

The Russain smile with satisfaction.
Indeed, Fred and George Weasley were the only ones who could sell jujus with this much markup in a wizarding school, in the middle of the entry hall, and right under Dumbledore's nose.
Their partnership was definitely profitable, for both parties.
Vlad simply had to look at his bank transcripts on his student account in Gringott's, or the new robes the twins wore.

"I know," he finally answered. "They're really good for contraband.

"They brother made a scene in the common room," Neville declared suddenly.

"Which one?"

"Percival.
Ronald followed suite, mostly because of jealousy."

"Why?"

"Well, since their business is so profitable, they bought new robes for they and Ginerva.
Percy wanted to know where the money came from, and Ron threw a tantrum, yelling that he also had a right to new clothes.
He does not care one bit about where the money comes from, as long as he can take advantage of it..."

"In both cases, it's not surprising.
Percy is a Prefect, and quite strict on rules, both the law, and Hogwarts' rules.
As for Ronald, he's just an idiot and has a cronic jealously problem," Draco noted.

"Why did they offer robes to Giverna?" Kevin asjed.
"Not that it bothers me, but it's surprising.
It's not their style to do something selflessly."

"They're trying to get her out of her own world, and make her tell where the journal is."

"That's what you call bribery," Draco sneered.

"It's taking too long," Vlad whispered.
"She's withering fast..."

Ginnny Weasley had gotten out the the Great Hall at this time, followed by Luna Lovegood.
If the redhead had been lively before coming to school, according to her brother, she was now pale, here skin near translucent.
It was not hard to see that she was lost weight and that the slightest effort was painful.

"And the professors never noticed a thing," Hermione groaned, as she looked anxiously at the girl's lifeless eyes.
"McGonagall came last evening, and she never looked at Ginny!"

"Did you try to talk to her?" kevin asked, looking at the pair moving through the hall.
Fred and George were also observing their sister while continuing business with a last year Hufflepuff.

"I did, and so did Neville.
She was so shy and fearfull that we prefered leaving her alone.
The thing with Colin did not help.
He was the only one, along with Lovegood, who could approach her.
They were always sitting together in class..."

"Luna seems worried as well."

The small blond Ravenclaw was carefully following her friend, babbling quickly.
While her attitude was as out there as usual, Luna's eyes were attentive for one.
She raised her head, like she had a sixth sense, and crossed Vladmir's gaze.
The young Russian softly smiled at her while nodding, reassuring her.
The previous day, the young girl had come to the boys' room to ask if they could do something for Ginny.
According to her, Nargles had told her that the two boys were the only ones able to help her friend get rid of the numerous Wrackspurts troubling Ginny's mind.

"Possession is increasingly certain," Draco whispered.
"She exhibits all the symptoms.
Absences, pale skin, excessive skinniness...
Frankly, the professors are incompetent...
We need to find this journal."

"What if we used a truth serum to get her to tell us where she hides it?" Hermione said softly.
"The twins regularly go through her room and she does not write in the common room any more."

"Which one?"

"The most potent is Veritaserum", Vlad declared.

"Good idea, but it's long and hard to prepare.
Even more than Polyjuice!"

"And in addition, its craft and ingredients are closely monitored," Neville noted.

"We have a Potions Master available, one whi invented it.
As for the ingredients, I am able to get them on short notice...
Hey Fred, you have Potions to review," Vladmir suddenly exclaimed, deactivating the silencing spell that surrounded them since the start of the discussion.

"Are you plotting again, gentlment?" a honeyed voice behind them asked.
The all jumped but Vladmir, who gave their Potions professor an innocent smile.

"You don't have Mr. Entwhistle's talent," Snape noted with a mocking sneer.

"I know," Vladmir left an exagerated sigh out, "but nobody's perfect, sadly.
It's only human nature."

"And now, going philosophical.
I dare hope this phase of yours passes quickly, or Merlin help us."

"You hurt me, Professor," Vladmir said with a grieved voice.
"I thought I had managed to break your ice shell, and made you an accomplice..."

"Tough love, Mister Kemenov."

"So you must love me, Professor, seeing how many detentions I get.
Do I need to expect a romantic declaration?" Neville intervened with pleading eyes.

The Potions Master looked horrified, staring at the young Gryffindor, utterly shocked by his words.
Neville's soft smile slowly widened as time passe, until it became carnivorous.

"And that's 30!
Fred, George, you owe me 10 Galleons," Neville yelled in direction of the twins who were now talking in front of the Great Hall doors, talismans disappeared.

"What?" the twins roared, running towards them.
"You've done it?"

Neville only pointed towards the Potions Master, whose mouth was still wide open, and reaching out his hand, under Snape's increasingly astounded look.
He slowly understood he had been the object of a bet between the second years and the twins.
He thought that they liked laughing at him quite a bit too much.
Between the discovery of the Sorting Hat, which made him the object of a wizarding photograph which, he was sure, would regularly leak out, and now this bet, Snape wondered if associating with this group of terribly intelligent and manipulating dunderheads."

"Blimey Professor, where's your legendary wit and sarcasm?" Fred whinged, depositing five Galleons in Neville's hand, immediately imitated by his brother.

"Indeed Professor, what have you done with your quick mind?" George complained.

Snape gave the group a scary smile back, and reached out his hand to Neville, palm up.
It was time to use his Slytherin mind.

"Mister Longbottom, I demand half of your profits as principal reason of your success."

"What? I won this money fair and square!"

"My five Galleons, please.
Or do we need to spend five hours detention together tonight?"

"Professor Snape... we understand..."

"... why you are the Head of Slytherin," George whispered with admiration.

"Not only you are sarcastic, but you're also twisted," Neville whispered, giving Snape what he wanted, as his friends laughed under their capes.
"Stop laughing you traitors!"

"I'm looking away from your... business," Snape whispered, "the least thing you could do is buy my silence, isn't it, Mr Longbottom and Weasleys?"

"What do you want Professor?" Draco eventually said, his breath still hoarse from all the laughing.

"Who said I wanted something in particular Draco?"

The blond Slytherin raised an eyebrow.
His friends had quickly realized that the Potions professor never ever called him by his first name in the public parts of the school.

"Your friends know I am your godfather," Snape sighed.

"No..."

"... We didn't!"

The Weasley twins seemed very interested by this piece of information.

"Ron constantly moans about your favouritism, especially concerning Malfoy," Fred explained.

"On the one hand, I suppose that, because of his insolent and catastrophic behaviour of our brother in class, it's your way to put up with him."

"Is it true he has exploded seven cauldrons?" Fred avidly asked.

"Truth be told, Mr. Weasley the sixth is not as talented as his older brothers.
You two are good when you put effort into my class, Charles and William were very good, even without much effort, and Percival works hard to keep up.
However, your brother has melted or exploded 47 cauldrons since his arrival in Hogwarts.
Even worse than you, Mister Longbottom, and he's on track to beat the all-time record."

"Godfather..."

"Yes, Draco?"

"Are you ill?
I'm a little worried about your mental health," the blond pointed out, noting Snape's surprised face.
"You have just praised no less than five Gryffindors, and Weasleys at that, in a single sentence!"

Snape's staggered look was admirable, and he left in a masterful cape whirl, his Slytherin dignity shattered.
He took the time to look daggers at the students who tried to be too curious, hoping to hear the conversation between the Greasy Dungeon Bat and the mysterious Alliance.

The group's name was starting to discreetly run in rumour, while Vladmir was still suspected to be the infamous Heir of the Chamber.
Many believed it was the reason he grew closer to the Malfoy heir.
The more reasonable noted, however, the presence of two Muggle-Borns at his side, as well as the young Logbottom, heir to a supposedly Light family...

However, Vladmir did not care one bit about the rumours.
It had been a month that he put up with the unkind remarks from the other students, and he had eventually learned to ignore the whispers that followed him wherever he went.

As always, the Ravenclaws had stayed neutral.
Vladmir was one of theirs, and their solidarity was examplary.
The eagles had continually assured him of their support, by discreet gestures.
A greeting by other years, although Vlad did not know them, the rational arguments they used to defend him when other suspected him...

Slytherins... were true to themselves.
Draco was still their prince, despite his relationships with Hermione and Neville, who were in the Enemy House.
No Slytherin allowed themselves to spread the rumours further, preferring to stay in Draco's good graces.
They simply ingored the Russian, or even discreetly supported him, like Draco's friends did, most notably Theodore Nott and Blaise Zabini.

However, to his great surprise, the worse ones were not the Gryffindors, but the Hufflepuffs.
All expected to get attacked by Gryffindors, but two second-year Hufflepuffs spread many rumours, and one could smell the fear around the House...

"You are an idiot, MacMillan!
Blimey, your parents knew the Potters, you should know that Vladmir is not a Dark Mage!"

"He didn't use much Light Magic in his duel, didn't he?"

"Don't meddle in it, Justin, you don't know magical traditions!"

A fleeting moment passed over the conversation, as Justin was attacked on his blood status.

"He's hanging around Slytherins!"

"So? Daphne Greengrass is an excellent friend, and you don't say much when she sits next to me in the Library!"

All the Alliance membres looked, with great surprise, at a young ginger Hufflepuff girl lash out at Ernest Macmillan and Justin Finch-Fletchley, the two most vindictive students when it came to Vladmir.

The Russian's face slowly went expressionless as the Hufflepuffs kept arguing in the middle of the hall in a lower voice.
Until Susan Bones got her wand out and pointed it to her Housemates.
Vlamdir stood up calmly, and walked towards her, seeing a Gryffindor Prefect running for a Professor.
So much for the lions' courage...
Ernie and Justin paled when he saw him get towards them, but Susan did not realize it immediately, her words still particularly angry.

"Leave it, Bones," he intervened. "I'd rather you did not become a pariah in your own House because of me."

Vladmir had suddenly appeared behind her, perfectly expressionless, and had put a hand on her arm.

"For now, Kemenov, we are still engaged," Susan responded without looking at him, wand still pointed at Justin Finch-Fletchley, "and your honour is what is best for me!"

Stupefied hiccups rang out of the curious students that had approched the commotion, as well as Professor Sinistra who had jsut arrived.
Magical engagement were rare, and were rarely brought up by the involved people this quickly.

"You... you are engaged to... to..." Justin stuttered.
"You are only..."

Susan sniffled comptentuously, worthy of a Slytherin, and turned away from them, putting he wand away.

"I am true to my word, Kemenov."

"I know," the young Russian agreed.
"And I admire you for this.
You are fundamentally loyal."

"I am a Hufflepuff," Susan reminded him with a small smile.

Vlamdir smiled back, a relatively soft smile coming from him, and gallantly took her arm, before turning towards her Housemates.

"Maybe for you, Finch-Fetchley, magical engagement in accordance with ancient laws do not mean anything, but you, MacMillan, you know their meaning.
Molest my fiancée again, verbally or physically, and I will be in the arena with you."

"What..."

Ernie MacMillan suddenly put a hand on his friend's shoulder, face now green and full of swear.
Professor Sinistra apparently did not want to intervene, perfectly knowledgeable about Vladmir's right to defend his fiancée's honour.

"Leave it Justin, I don't want a honour duel because we insulted Susan."

The two Hufflepuff's gaze went to Vladmir's friends, still sitting on the steps.
Kevin and Draco had near-identical contempt on their faces as they watched them, Hermione pinched her lips together, but her eyes shone with anger, and her magic made her hair flutter about.
Neville, for his part, was seemingly still the same scared boy, from the faces he made when looking at Malfoy.

"Oi, Neville!
If you want, you can come with us," Ernie invited him.

An amused smile suddenly stretched Neville's lips, before disappearing so fast that Ernie MacMillan thought he had dreamed it.
The Gryffindor vigorously shook his head, and stuttered a polite thank, making Draco and Kevin laugh.

"Why do you stay with them?" Justin's voice rose up.
"They're mocking you constantly!"

"They... they're my... my friends!"

Only his friends could see that he was, in fact, trying hard not to laugh as well, and keep his nervous and clumsy young boy facade, that he wanted to keep until the end of his school years.
Because Kevin and Draco were indeed laughing at him, amused to see him sport verbal and non-verbal languages so far from his real personality.

Vlamdir, still next to Suasan, sneered comptentously and turned towards her.

"May I walk you back?"

"With pleasure," the young Bones politely answered.

Ignoring the two Hufflepuffs who were now lashing out at the Alliance membres, the couple walked towards the Hufflepuff common room.
Vlad had just the time to see Professor Sinistra approch the two Hufflepuffs, before they turned at a corner.

They walked in an awkward silence, Susan visibly lost in dark thoughts.
Vlamdir did not try to fill the silence.
After all, they did not know each other, having only discovered their betrothal suring the school break, and they they would probably not know each other much more after the Christmas break, when the contract would be broken.

"Were the threat necessary?" Susan asked, whispering, as Vladmir stopped in the corridor where the Hufflepuff door was hidden.

"Maybe not," he conceded, "but I am how I am.
Russian wizards have a high sense of familial honour."

"The infamous polar mages..."

"Indeed.
Even if we know that after Christmas, we will be free from any commitment, for now, we are betrother, and your honour is what is best for me, as you said so well."

Susan softly looked at Vladmir, and raised herself on her toe tips to kiss his cheek.

"I am not sure why you lost your childhood, Vlad, but I think it's quite sad that you are so... hard and infelxible."

"Such big words, Susan.
I am not inflexible, I am way to adaptable for that."

"With you, I don't think simple words suffice," Susan sighed.
"You seem to live in another world.
You can be as arrogant as traditionalist Pure-Bloods, and yet, you are so loyal to your kin...
I'd be curious to know your family..."

"Let me warn you right now, Bones, you don't want to know my world.
It's a world of clan wars, duels and death.
And for your information, I am from a traditionalist family, probably more than most in England."

"Why do I feel like you are not a child any more?
Why are you so different from other Hogwarts students?
Even Slytherins are more carefree than you are!"

"You do not want to know my world," Vladmir repeated softly, brushing her cheek, making her shiver in fear.

Indeed, Susan did not want to know the young Kemenov's daily life.
At night, nightmares still woke her up.
Nightmares involving a quite violent duel.
Amelia Bones' niece remembered Vladmir's absence during the previous year, and when he came back, still injured when magic could heal most wounds.
She remembered the fight in the Great Hall.
Her aunt had warned her.
She had told her not to watch the duel, but she had been too excited to listen to her...
How she regretted her, when she had seen the violence and thirst for death of her fiancé, then his despair.

"In less than a month, you will be free from any commitment to me, Susan.
Good night."

Susan suddenly raised her head, and stayed frozen in the empty corridor, as a tear ran down her cheek.
She was not as brave as Gryffindors, and Vladmir, she suddenly realised, scare her.
Susan was terrified by the many faces the Russian could display.
How could a twelve-year-old become so... horrifying?

Susan Bones, entering her common room, did not realise that Vladmir had stayed in the shadows.
He had wanted to learn the exact place of the Hufflepuff common room entryay, but he did not want to be seen there without a good reason, and Susan had just provided it to him.
He then walked back to the Alliance HQ with a big smile.
He now knew where all four common rooms were.

<hr>

When he enventually reached the HQ, everyone was waiting for him, even Snape and the Weasley twins, and...

"What is Luna doing there?" he asked, calmly sitting down in the last free chair, observing the first-year.

"Miss Lovegood managed to enter, despite the _Fidelius_ Charm.
I was the first to arrive, and she was already here.
Neville assured us he did not reveal anything."

All watched the young girl who was staring at the huge tapestry that Draco, Neville and Kevin had chosen the day after they created the Alliance.
They had somehow managed to convince the House Elves to create the immense art piece and charm it.
Different animals were represented, around a huge protection circle made of runes.

In the middle, the school coat-of-arms was represented, underneath its protector dragon, but one could see the symbols of the Mirage Court and the Alliance by watching carefully.
They had chosen a simple white ring as a symbol for their union, over which an ivy vine ran, representing friend and loyalty according to Neville.
The most interesting thing about the tapestry, however, were the animals.
Each membre had its onw, and they magically appeared once they were included in the Alliance's _Fidelius_ Charm.
tThey personified the membres, and for now, a marten, an otter, a lion, a snake, two monkeys, a crow, a salamander, and a sheep were aroung the castle.
However, a new shape was slowly appearing, between the sheep and the lion...
A small hummingbird.

"Well, welcome to the Alliance, Luna."

Snape spat out his tea on André, who vehemently protested.

"Be careful, young man!" the Sorting Hat exclaimed.

The Potions professor looked increduously at the venerable artefact follwing his 'young man' remark, before looking back at Luna with scepticism in his eyes.

"Just like that, Kemenov?"

"That's Luna for you," the Russian responded mysteriously, shrugging.
"In any case, she appears in the tapestry."

But Vladmir had to admit that to understand the young girl, one had to really talk with her.
One could not realise at a glance that she had this high intelligence and a gift that could be an excellent asset to them, one that she kept behind a soft madness facade.
Snape pinched the bridge of his noe, then changed subjets.
He would probably not get more information from Vladmir.

"Why did you wish to see me here?"

"You suspected we were plotting something in the afternoon."

"So I was right," the Prfessor proudly said.

"We need your talent in Potions."

"Which one?" the Potions Master suspisciously asked.
Rigtly so, beceause he spat out his tea on André one again when he hear the name of the potion, getting the Sorting Hat's ire one again.
Hermione cast a cleaning charm on it, as Snape raged against them.

"Veritaserum?
Are you out of your minds?
That's the potion the Ministry controls the most, and you need specific clearance just to get the ingredients...
Its illegal usage is a one-way ticket to Azkaban!"

"You have the clearance", Hermione noted.
"You are its creator, and I am certain you have all the ingredients in your store.
If need be, Vlad could get you the rest.
As for Azkaban, as long as no one suspects its use, we'll be fine."

"Miss Granger, since you seem to be the one that brought that thought to them, please explain briefly the reasons that brought this potion to mind, against all reasonable thoughts."

Hermione sighed, then looked at the Weasley twins and Vladmir.
All three nodded, then the young lioness quickly and clearly summarized Ginerva Weasley's problems, that they thought connected to the Chamber of Secrets.
Snape seemed lost in his thoughts, then eventually sighed.

"If she is really possessed, then the mind can refuse the potion."

"No," Fred intervened.
"Veritaserum is tasteless and odourless.
We have gotten used to brigging her a glass of pumkin juice each morning, since she doesn't go to breakfast any more."

"We could slip it in her glass one morning, and question her afterwards.
She generally stays alone in the common room until the classes start," George continued.

"I see you thought of everything...
Alright, I will help you prepare the potion.
Mr and Mr Weasley, you are the oldest ones, and veritable geniouses in Potions.
Don't tell me otherwise, I would not believe you!
If you want my opinion, most of your pranks are potions-based, and they are good.
Even if it is unfortunate that you don't pay attention in class, and you only want to create... entertainment," Snape sniffed.
"You will thus help me.
Mr. Kemenov, do you have an idea where we can create the potion?"

"The HQ.
It's the most secure place in Hogwarts for us."

"There is no equipment here."

"As are all possible room in Hogwarts, apart from the Potions classrooms and laboratories," Kevin declare.
"And that is out of the question, because they are all monitored.
As a Potions Master, you have a private laboratory, don't you?"

"I have one, but Dumbledore also monitors it."

All members of the Alliance who grew up in the magical world instantly frowned.

"But it's your Master laboratory, isn't it?
He cannot get in without your invitation, it's in the charter of the Masters' Association!
Whether you are a Potions, Charms, Herborist Master, researched made in a Master's laboratory is strictly private!" Draco's voice rose up.

"Tell that to the Headmaster," Severus Snape sighed.
"I have not created a new potion in years because of that.

"That's deeply unfair!" Hermione exclaimed.
"You are a Potions Master before being Hogwart's Potions Professor!"

"What about the Princes' laboratory?" Draco asked.
"Apparently, it was state of the art in Adrius Prince's time."

This simple sentence made Snape realise that Vladmir was right since the beginning.
Even if Lucius had taken the time to tell him about the legends when he had barged at his place, completely panicked after what Vladmir had told him a few weeks ago, Snape still had a hard time getting used to the idea that he had spent half his life ingoring his heritage.
Lord Malfoy had been devastated when he realised that nobody had informed Severus that he could not have been disowned, and that his line was important in the magical world."

"How do you know I am a Prince?" Snape lowly asked, "and that I am not disowned."

"Father told me that your mother was the last of the Prince Line.
And that this line could not disown a child.
It's one of the Five Families," Draco asked, suddenly worried.
"Didn't you know?"

"Not before a few weeks ago," Snape admitted.
"And even if I could use the Prince laboratory, I cannot leave the school, and neither can the other professors.

"What about your family life?" Kevin asked, curiosity palpable in his voice.

"We don't have any, or any more," the Professor sighe, not getting into details to preserve his and his colleagues' privacy.

"It was one of the initial clauses of the Hogwart's charter," André suddenly declared.
"However, subsequent Headmasters from a few centuries afterwards forgot to say that families are welcome in the school.
There are about thirty familial appartments that are linked in the Floo network.
I remember a time when I told the legends of Hogwarts to tolders not much taller than I ma now by the fireside...
Houses helped each other, and life was good..."

André's melancholic tone had a deep sadness in it, which move everyone.
They all tried to imagine a warm Hogwarts, with children running around the students, under the watchful eyes of their parents and the professors..."

"I will ask Hogwarts to create a laboratory, included in the _Fidelius_ of the Alliance room."

All wondered that they had heard it well.

"Pardon?"

"Hogwarts will create a room?"

"Hogwarts is a magical entity," the Sorting Hat said, smiling.
"It has its own will, and what is does, the Headmaster is not privy to.
It is absolutely autonomous, and its authority is hiher than Dumbledore's.
the Founders created it to be able to counteract an malicious Headmaster, or one not caring about the students' safety."

"What about the current attacks?" Hermione asked, "can't it do anything about them?"

"It can't.
The attacks are by Sasssly.
She belongs to the school the same way I do, and as she's controlled by the Heir of Slytherin, Hogwarts can't do anything.
Conflict of magical interests."

"The Heir of Slytherin?
The last one to claim to be the heir is...
Merlin!" Snape's words spurt out.
"He's already back.
And you think Miss Weasley is posessed by Voldemort..."

All stayed silent, leaving enough time for Snape to understand the school's troubles, until he started laughing, nearly hysterically.
Just seeing him smile was surprising, seeing him laugh was unsettling...

"What is so hilarious?" Kevin asked, curious.

"You are only a small group of eleven to fourteen-year-olds, and you are better organised than the Order of the Phoenix.
You have powerful allies in the heirs of three of the greatest magical families in England, and Hogwarts itself.
It's just... so exquisite," the Potions Master sneered.

"Four," Draco sighed. "The Alliance has four heirs, godfather.
You forget to count yourself in."

"By the way... Who is Sasssly?" Kevin suddenly asked.

"Salazar's familiar," Luna answered.
"She's adorable and so soft."

"Er... Luna, are we talking about the Basilisk in the Chamber of Secrets?"

"Wrackspurts are leaving your mind," the young Lovegood said enthusiastically, looking at Hermione.

"That's a yes," Vlad translated with a smile.

"Vlad, official Lovegood language translator," Kevin sneered.
"Hermione, you told me something last week, now that we're all here, it's time to tell us all, isn't it?"

Hermione blushed a bit when they all looked at her, then she exposed her idea.
She kne Snape had the Dark Mark, and she thought that, although it was very Dark magic, the principle was intersting.
Snape griaced, but all the others nodded.
The idea of being able to signal the others they needed them could be interesting and most inconspicuous than waiting for them at the end of the classes or slipping notes.
When done, they could catch each other's attention.
Hermione had researched to find a way to communicate.
She wanted to charm a simple object to create an alert.

"The point is tell each other when we need a meeting, but also when there's danger," Kevin concluded, as he had helped Hermione research this subject in the Library.

"How do you plan on doing this, Ms. Granger?" Snape asked, interested.

Those students definitely intrigued him.
They were so... incredibly smart, loyal, and dangerous.
Slowly, an organisation pattern was starting to appear in the mind of the Potions Master, fully trained to analyse every detail of his environment because of his former occupation as a spy.
Out of the seven membres already fully integrated, he did not count himself, nor Luna Lovegood in, at least not yet...
Draco, Neville and Vladmir were what he would describe as the field team.
The most dangerous ones because they grew up in the magical world and knew many speels.
Merlin, he still had a hard time telling himself Neville was dangerous, and yet he was...
Kevin was the backup, but he generally was with Hermione as the research and technical support team.
A team that was remarkably efficient, from what he had seen in the Library.

"Well, I thought about coupling a warming spell and a Portkey," Hermione explained.
"You could simply touch the object with a triggering password to warm all the objects, announcing a meeting.
Plus, I was thinking about an alert password that would brutally freeze the object, to say someone was in danger.
The Portkey would allow for the others to get to the member via a connection between the objects."

"That's brilliant, Hermione," Neville declared.
"However, that's quite advanced magic, and quite monitored by the Ministry."

"Monitored?" Vladmir said mockingly.
"Anyone can create a Portkey."

"Yeah, compared to Russia, it's a joke," Neville admitted, remembering the legislation on the usage of Portkeys in Vladmir's country.
"But they still involve dangerous spells."

"Not so much," Hermione said.
"The alert charm is used by parents to allow their children to tell them easily.
They are available in most charms shops."

"And short-distance Portkeys are included in the charms," the Potions Professor nodded.
"Extremely well thought out, Ms. Granger.
The school covers 120 hectares, and most of those kinds of Portkeys have a range of ten or so kilometres...
That's more than enough...
But suddenly bying a dozen charms could raise suspicions."

"Not if Vladmir helps us with that."

Vladmir nodded.
Indeed, he could get those child alarm quickly.

"Miss Granger, you are way more intelligent than your behaviour in class lets up," Professor Snape said.
"You don't just know your lessons, you use your mind as well."

Hermione smiled back when she heard the compliment disgusied under a quite scornful remark, and she asked what object they could use.

"Gold shines."

"Luna is right," Vlad adeed, as Luna got back to gazing at the magical clock that showed the position of the mmebres in Hogwarts.
"A Galleon, common enough to not get looks, and small enough to not be seen."

"The conversation continued for a while, coordinating on the other terms.
André asured them that Hogwarts would create the Potions laboratory during the night, Vlad promised that he would get the missing ingredients for the end of the weekd, and Hermione told them that she would start creating the Galleons charms before the weekend.

Suddenly, the magical clock rang out.
They all jumped, and the Potions Professor asked for the reason of this sound, seeing them all immediately stand up.
Kevin had modified the clock so that it rang a quarter of an hour befor the curfew, allowing them to get back to their common room without risking detention.
Admirably well thought out and useful...

"By the way, youngsters, a duelling club will open," Snape declared before going out of the room.
"Not that you need it, but I think you could enjoy the spectacle.
I will supervise it with Professor Lockhart."

Needless to that, this piece of news raised theirenthousiasme, and they all impatiently waited for the opening night.
The official announcement arrived a week later, posted in front of the entry hall's portraits.
Gryffindors were ecstatic, pressing themselves around the small parchment annoncing the creating of a duelling club, and in just one morning, all the school learned that each day of the week, one year would have a duelling class...

<hr>

That same evening, they got together with virtually all the second-year students in the Great Hall, which had been reorganised.
It looked like during Vladmir's duel, and numerous students actually whispered in his wake, wondering why he was here.
It was clear that he did not need to learn more, but Vladmir ingored them as usual.

"I'm impatient to see Lockhart," Kevin declared, before smiling as he saw him appear.

"He quite likes purple," Neville noted, leering at the elegant lilac robes the wizard wore.

"This robe is quite esthetic, but absolutely not practical, contrary to Sev's," Draco admitted.

"Sev?" Vlad asked, amused.

Indeed, Draco was right: Professor Snape, entirely in black as always, wore real duelling robes. They were plain, practical, and full of defensive spells.

"We better be prudent with this dingus," Neville finally said, still not over the Corwall Pixies incident from the start of the year.
"He is dangerous in his stupidity."

"Gather round, gather round!
Can everybody see me?
Can everybody hear me?"

"Unfortunately," Kevin grumbled, making his friends laugh.

"Perfect!
Professor Dumbledore allowed me to open this duelling club to teach you a few ways to defnd yourselves from some aggressor, as happened to me countless times.
For more details, please refer my complete collection of books."

"What... What..." Kevin stuttered, gobsmacked by the man's cheek.

"Opportunist?" Neville asked.

"I will now introduce you to my assistant, Professor Snape!"

Kevin finally laughed out loud when Lockhart added that the Potions Master had a few notions of duelling, and that they should not worry for him, because he would not cast any disabling hex.
Snape contemptuous grin was exquisite and terrifying at the same time.

"Lockhart is an idiot.
If one of them risks getting injured, it's him," Draco declared.
"Sev was a youth national duelling champion, and he regularly trains with Flitwick."

Then, the two professors quickly explained the rules of duelling, and bowed to each other, before walking away and assuming regulation postures.
Snape was unsurprisingly the fastest, and cast a simple Diasrming charm to the Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher, who was thrown against all before slumping down to the ground.
The Slytherins and the Alliance members clapped with statisfaction, as Lockhart was trying his best to get up, pale and ruffled.

"Excellent demonstration, Professor Snape," he said while walking back up on the stage, his step not quite straight and looking for his wand.
"This charm allows one to disarm his opponent, and--thank you Miss Brown-- it is an excellent idea to show them that, but with all due respect, I instantly guessed what you had in mind and..."

"Mister Kemenov," Snape cut him, looking daggers at Lockhart.
"You are undeniably used to duelling.
Any comment on this duel?"

"Are you sure, Professor?" Vladmir calmly asked, as all turned towards him.

"If you please."

"Very well.
First, it has to be said that the rules and postures you presented were those of international duelling cometitions, an not necessarily those of honour duels, which are different in each country.
Next, un terms of small analysis, the way a duellist bows is quite characteristic.
From your bow, you seem to prefer a sober and efficient style, while Professor Lockhart seems more... embellished, not to say pompous," Vladmir sneered.

Lockhart wanted to talk, but Snape cut him once again, and asked Vladmir to analyse the first rally.

"The first rally shows two things to both the duellists and the observers.
The power of each duellist, as well as an idea of how the duel will end.
You are faster than your opponent, and quite powerful.
Your chances of victory are thus higher than your opponent's.
A Disarming charm cast by a common wizard might make their opponent walk back a few steps;
You outright ejected yours by a dozen meters.
I will end by saying that since Professor Lockhart left the platform, he lost according to international competition regulations."

"Thank you, the demonstration is done," the Defense Professor intervened, crimson because of both shame, and anger at being indirectly described as incompetent by a second-year student.
"Il will pair you up.
Professor Snape, if you could help me with that..."

Groups were quickly formed, and duels started under Lockhart's orders, before Snape could say anything.
Vlad and Snape were alarmed that the Defense Professor's incompetence led to hexes being cast at once, in an impressive cacophony.
Vlad barely managed to dodge a stray spell that unfortunately hit a Ravenclaw and transformed him into something between a dog and a gnome.
In the corner of his eye, he saw Hermione punch a Slytherin girl, before locking her in a chocking hold.
Kevin and Neville observed the smelly green cloud floating above a Hufflepuff group with quite the interest, and Draco laughed at seeing Ronald Weasley throw up slugs.

"_Finite Incantatem_!" Snape yelled.

His spell reached across the room, and cancelled most of the active hexes.
His face was whtie in anger as he tried to kill his colleague with his gaze, while Lockhart was going student to student, healing the wounded ones.
Hermione went back to her friends with a big petty smile as her opponent was bleeding from her nose, which was apparently broken.

"Did Bulstrode call you a Mudblood?"

"Yes, she did.
I showed her that the Muggle way could hurt as well."

"I think we should teach you how to protect yourselves from hexes first," Professor Lockhart declared restlessly, walking back to the stage.
"Let's take two volunteers.
Maybe Finnegan and Longbottom."

"Very bad idea, professor Lockhart," Snape cut him.
"Longbottom sows cahos any time he tries to cast a spell, and Finnegan tends to explode eerything, including himself.
There would not be much of those two afterwards.
Why not..."

"Mr. Kemenov, could you give us a demonstration?" Lockhart asked with a smile, cutting his colleague, who did not appreciate it.

"I hope you are kidding, Gilderoy," Snape groaned.
"Entwhistle, Malefoy, come here, both of you."

"Excellent idea!
Kevin, when Draco points his wand to you, you'll do this..."

Kevin looked at the professor make complicated gestures with a contempt so visible that made the Ravenclaw and Slytherins laugh, before the Professor droped his wand, making Kevin smile mockingly.

"You certainly don't know me if you think I will drop my wand, Professor," he clearly said.
"And I will not imitate your incorrect gesture of a protection charm."

Many students laughed, as some booed the Ravenclaw for his outwardly insulting words.
Finally, the two friends faced each other.

"Afraid, Entwhistle?" Draco whispered.

"You wish, Malfoy," Kevin answered, becoming serious.
They both stared at each othe before getting into position.

"_Stupefy!"

"_Protego_."

"_Rictusempra_."

"_Expelliarmus_!"

Shocked whispers started to grow, as the spells flew, clearly superiors compared to the ones they learned in class.
Draco rolled on the ground to avoid the Disarming charm, and immediately cast one of his own.

"Serpensortia_!"

A small ice viper slithered out of the Slytherin's wand, and looked around her, clearly confused.

"_Blimey, can't one sssleep in peaccce?" she hissed.

"Sasha?" Kevin asked, clearly surprised, looking at Vladmir's quite angry familiar.

"Don't move Entwhistle," Snape calmly said.
"It's a particularly dangerous species.
I will..."

"I will do it!"

Lockhart pointed is wand to the snake and something exploded.
However, the reptile did not disappear, but was thrown up high, and violently landed, hissing in fury, trying to find the one responsible for this.
She turned towards Justin Finch-Fletchley, the closest to her, and showhed her fangs.

"_Leave him Sasha, it's not him_," Kevin sighed. "_Come_."

Sasha hissed once more and approached Kevin, who had kneeled, reaching his hand out to the ground.

"Mister Entwhistle, it's an..."

"Ice viper, named Sasha," Kevin said, as Sasha climbed around his arm to reach his collar, where it was hot, hissing with happiness.

"_You are hot, it's good.
I don't like being summonded like this_."

"_Don't worry, we'll be in the dormitories soon._"

"What's your problem?" Justin suddenly asked, furious and scared.

"I saved your life, you idiot.
Sasha was disoriented, and she would have biten anyone.
You in this case.
You'd have been dead in a few minutes, after you felt agonising pain."

The young Muggle-Born turned away, and approched Vladmir, who sighed.

"Let's go."

The twi Ravenclaws immediately walked out the room, as the other students moved away in front of therm.
They both knew why, and they already were hearing the rumours grow among the second-years.
Kevin, Muggle-Born and Parsletongue?
Impossible.

"Parsletongue is a lannguage like any other.
You can learn it if you want to," the young Ravenclaw delcared loudly, not looking at his schoolmates, before walking out the door of the Great Hall.

<hr>

A few hours later, Kevin was staring at the curtains of his canopy bed.
Sasha was in a ball on his belly, trying to confort him, while he distractedly caressed her scales.
Rumours had already spread across the castle, and he wondered how the next day would go.
On the other hand, he did not care that much...

"You know, Vlad," he eventually said, catching his friend's attention, who was writing a letter to Katya, keeping her informed of the lateste development, "I don't care what other people think."

Vladmr put down his quill and observed his friend, lost in his thoughts.
Kevin slowly sat up, letting Sasha slip on his lap.
The small viper kockingly protested, before coiling back on his knees.

"I know they'll think I'm a Dark Mage.
But the only opinions I care about in this bloody school," the young Muggle-Born softly continued, "are yours, Hermione's, Draco's and Neville's."

"And we'll always support you," Vladmir softly responded.
"Don't doubt it."

It was enough for Kevin, who smiled at him softly before lying back down and closing his eyes.
The next day would be a long one.
