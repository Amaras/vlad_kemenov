## Chapter 24: The Heir

Kevin observed and memorised everything.
Few people had understood this innated instinct that allowed the young Muggle-Born to record the smallest facts and gestures, and the smallest details in his environment.
It was this ability and his will to learn everything in order to blend in his surroundings that got him into Ravenclaw.

Kevin was not a genius, but he had a gift for observation.
And Vladmir, while learning to know his friend, had quickly understood the advantages it could bring their little group.

Hermione and Kein had numerous points in commin.
They understood each other perfectly without ever talking.
They both never had any friends in their childhood, their memory and ability to learn serving them badly when the other children were looking for stories and play.
Hermione was a young girl from a good family, be she was the target of mockery.
Kevin was a young boy with coal digger parents, he was born in coal and had prayed everyday to be able to leave the sad town of dark-faced people he was born in, and where no one, not even his paretns, had ever understood him.

It was thus pretty natural for the both of them to meet in the library, on the table thathad regularly been theirs and their friends' for the last two years.
The events from the previous night had triggered their thrist for knowledge.

They did not say anything, but their organisation was methodical and efficient.
He went through the shelves, using his incredible memory to retrieve the texts he had already read, while she read every single line that was adjacent to their research subject.

Afteer the incident from the previous night, the Alliance had talked until late at night, looking for answers to their numerous questions.
The main one, the one the whole school was wondering about, was the meaning of 'Heir'...
By discovering the identity of this person, they would know the reasons of the attack, and how to stop them.
Because the message implied that this petrification would not be the last.

The second question was to know if Ginerva Weasley's problem was linked to this mysterious heir.
After all, possession was one of the darkest forms of magic in the world...

The third one was more a speculation.
They were looking for information about Narcissa Malfoy's role in those events.
Draco was deeply worried about the link between the three problems, convinced they were linked together.
And all of them were thinking the same thing...
Another problem was that most students now thought that Vladmir was responsible for this, thinking he was the dangerous Heir who paralysed Mrs. Norris.
The duel had left a deep impression on their minds...

Kevin went through another shelf and distractedly two books, this time about sould possession, before getting back to his train of though.
Vlad was their friend.
Their first friend, actually, for each of the two Muggle-Borns.
He was the only one that saw something other than a labour instrument in them.
The only one who saw their feelings under their intelligence.
The Russian had opened the magical world to them more surely than school ever could have and probably with more possibilities than they could have imagined without him.
Because Hermione never forgot what Vladmir had told her the day of the Sorting Ceremony.

"Half of Muggle-Borns leave the magical world a few years after they graduate."

She had hated him at first, this haughty and arrogant boy who took pleasure in lying to prospective Muggle-Born wizard...
Out of conscience, she had nonetheless investigated this claim, before sadly discovering that Vlamdir Kemenov had not lied...

Kevin, for his part, had quickly understood the reality of the wizarding world by observing the relationships between students.
The barrier between Pure-Bloods and Muggle-Borns was too big for him not to notice and he had drawn a sad conclusion.
The wizarding world would not bring them anything unless they had solid relationships with old families...
And their heirs simply did not socialized with "Mudbloods", the ones they considered as the mire of society.
The future of a Muggle-Born among wizards was null.

Getting closer with Vladmir was not something they had planned, but it had happened, and Hermione and Kevin could only be grateful about it.
Even if the veneers of the magical world became darker than they could had ever dreamt of, following Vladmir, Prince of the Mirage Court, made them alive.
They belonged to a group of friend that accepted them as they were, with their talents and their flaws...
And their future seemed bright, especially compared to what it would have been before.
What would they have done once they left the magical world behind, without any diploma?
Kevin knew...
He would have ended up in the mines, with his five brothers and sisters.
Hermione, meanwhile, would probably have to work in a factory, unless her parents paid for new studies.

Kevin set down another pile of old books in front of Hermione, and looked at the ones shar had already finished reading.
He had to admit that she assimilated quite an astronomical amount of information in a miniscule amount of time, browsing the volumes at a breakneck pace.

_Hogwarts Legends_, by Angus Ravenclaw, 1534.

Without sitting down, he read the paragraph had highlighted with a pencil, a discreet circle on the first interesting line that she ereased as soon as she had read the lines.
Sometimes, they both wondered why wizards did not use Muggle inventions more often...

> Hogwarts is full of legends.
> Each founder added their own secret room to the initial architecture of the castle, creating a private space to their image.
> It is said that only the most deserving, or their heirs, would be able to find them.
>
> Rowena created the Room of Requirement, a mythical room able to invoker everything one needs, equally for relaxation, or for research.
> Only the initated can find and summon the room.
>
