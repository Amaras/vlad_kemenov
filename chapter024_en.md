## Chapter 24: The Heir

Kevin observed and memorised everything.
Few people had understood this innated instinct that allowed the young Muggle-Born to record the smallest facts and gestures, and the smallest details in his environment.
It was this ability and his will to learn everything in order to blend in his surroundings that got him into Ravenclaw.

Kevin was not a genius, but he had a gift for observation.
And Vladmir, while learning to know his friend, had quickly understood the advantages it could bring their little group.

Hermione and Kein had numerous points in commin.
They understood each other perfectly without ever talking.
They both never had any friends in their childhood, their memory and ability to learn serving them badly when the other children were looking for stories and play.
Hermione was a young girl from a good family, be she was the target of mockery.
Kevin was a young boy with coal digger parents, he was born in coal and had prayed everyday to be able to leave the sad town of dark-faced people he was born in, and where no one, not even his paretns, had ever understood him.

It was thus pretty natural for the both of them to meet in the library, on the table thathad regularly been theirs and their friends' for the last two years.
The events from the previous night had triggered their thrist for knowledge.

They did not say anything, but their organisation was methodical and efficient.
He went through the shelves, using his incredible memory to retrieve the texts he had already read, while she read every single line that was adjacent to their research subject.

Afteer the incident from the previous night, the Alliance had talked until late at night, looking for answers to their numerous questions.
The main one, the one the whole school was wondering about, was the meaning of 'Heir'...
By discovering the identity of this person, they would know the reasons of the attack, and how to stop them.
Because the message implied that this petrification would not be the last.

The second question was to know if Ginerva Weasley's problem was linked to this mysterious heir.
After all, possession was one of the darkest forms of magic in the world...

The third one was more a speculation.
They were looking for information about Narcissa Malfoy's role in those events.
Draco was deeply worried about the link between the three problems, convinced they were linked together.
And all of them were thinking the same thing...
Another problem was that most students now thought that Vladmir was responsible for this, thinking he was the dangerous Heir who paralysed Mrs. Norris.
The duel had left a deep impression on their minds...

Kevin went through another shelf and distractedly two books, this time about sould possession, before getting back to his train of though.
Vlad was their friend.
Their first friend, actually, for each of the two Muggle-Borns.
He was the only one that saw something other than a labour instrument in them.
The only one who saw their feelings under their intelligence.
The Russian had opened the magical world to them more surely than school ever could have and probably with more possibilities than they could have imagined without him.
