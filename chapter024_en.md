## Chapter 24: The Heir

Kevin observed and memorised everything.
Few people had understood this innated instinct that allowed the young Muggle-Born to record the smallest facts and gestures, and the smallest details in his environment.
It was this ability and his will to learn everything in order to blend in his surroundings that got him into Ravenclaw.

Kevin was not a genius, but he had a gift for observation.
And Vladmir, while learning to know his friend, had quickly understood the advantages it could bring their little group.

Hermione and Kein had numerous points in commin.
They understood each other perfectly without ever talking.
They both never had any friends in their childhood, their memory and ability to learn serving them badly when the other children were looking for stories and play.
Hermione was a young girl from a good family, be she was the target of mockery.
Kevin was a young boy with coal digger parents, he was born in coal and had prayed everyday to be able to leave the sad town of dark-faced people he was born in, and where no one, not even his paretns, had ever understood him.

It was thus pretty natural for the both of them to meet in the library, on the table thathad regularly been theirs and their friends' for the last two years.
The events from the previous night had triggered their thrist for knowledge.

They did not say anything, but their organisation was methodical and efficient.
He went through the shelves, using his incredible memory to retrieve the texts he had already read, while she read every single line that was adjacent to their research subject.

Afteer the incident from the previous night, the Alliance had talked until late at night, looking for answers to their numerous questions.
The main one, the one the whole school was wondering about, was the meaning of 'Heir'...
By discovering the identity of this person, they would know the reasons of the attack, and how to stop them.
Because the message implied that this petrification would not be the last.

The second question was to know if Ginerva Weasley's problem was linked to this mysterious heir.
After all, possession was one of the darkest forms of magic in the world...

The third one was more a speculation.
They were looking for information about Narcissa Malfoy's role in those events.
Draco was deeply worried about the link between the three problems, convinced they were linked together.
And all of them were thinking the same thing...
Another problem was that most students now thought that Vladmir was responsible for this, thinking he was the dangerous Heir who paralysed Mrs. Norris.
The duel had left a deep impression on their minds...

Kevin went through another shelf and distractedly two books, this time about sould possession, before getting back to his train of though.
Vlad was their friend.
Their first friend, actually, for each of the two Muggle-Borns.
He was the only one that saw something other than a labour instrument in them.
The only one who saw their feelings under their intelligence.
The Russian had opened the magical world to them more surely than school ever could have and probably with more possibilities than they could have imagined without him.
Because Hermione never forgot what Vladmir had told her the day of the Sorting Ceremony.

"Half of Muggle-Borns leave the magical world a few years after they graduate."

She had hated him at first, this haughty and arrogant boy who took pleasure in lying to prospective Muggle-Born wizard...
Out of conscience, she had nonetheless investigated this claim, before sadly discovering that Vlamdir Kemenov had not lied...

Kevin, for his part, had quickly understood the reality of the wizarding world by observing the relationships between students.
The barrier between Pure-Bloods and Muggle-Borns was too big for him not to notice and he had drawn a sad conclusion.
The wizarding world would not bring them anything unless they had solid relationships with old families...
And their heirs simply did not socialized with "Mudbloods", the ones they considered as the mire of society.
The future of a Muggle-Born among wizards was null.

Getting closer with Vladmir was not something they had planned, but it had happened, and Hermione and Kevin could only be grateful about it.
Even if the veneers of the magical world became darker than they could had ever dreamt of, following Vladmir, Prince of the Mirage Court, made them alive.
They belonged to a group of friend that accepted them as they were, with their talents and their flaws...
And their future seemed bright, especially compared to what it would have been before.
What would they have done once they left the magical world behind, without any diploma?
Kevin knew...
He would have ended up in the mines, with his five brothers and sisters.
Hermione, meanwhile, would probably have to work in a factory, unless her parents paid for new studies.

Kevin set down another pile of old books in front of Hermione, and looked at the ones she had already finished reading.
He had to admit that she assimilated quite an astronomical amount of information in a miniscule amount of time, browsing the volumes at a breakneck pace.

_Hogwarts Legends_, by Angus Ravenclaw, 1534.

Without sitting down, he read the paragraph had highlighted with a pencil, a discreet circle on the first interesting line that she ereased as soon as she had read the lines.
Sometimes, they both wondered why wizards did not use Muggle inventions more often...

> Hogwarts is full of legends.
> Each founder added their own secret room to the initial architecture of the castle, creating a private space to their image.
> It is said that only the most deserving, or their heirs, would be able to find them.
>
> Rowena created the Room of Requirement, a mythical room able to invoker everything one needs, equally for relaxation, or for research.
> Only the initated can find and summon the room.
>
> Godric installed the Duelling Room deep in the dungeons, able to materialise the most hostile environments for magical combat practice.
> According to rumours, only a powerful warrior is able to find them.
>
> Helga had Magical Greenhouses built under a great dome in the centre of the castle.
> Some say they are close to the Hufflepuff common room, but this House's location is the msot secret of all, and only its students know the truth.
>
> Salazar hid somewhere in the castle a perfectly secure room for his potions experiments, protecting the students from possible explosions.
> Legends say that he had a pet to protect its entrance.
> His decendents only can find his laboratories.

Kevin stopped reading and looked back at Hermione, who pushed two books she had put away towards him.

_Salazar Slytherin, life and work_, by Elizabeth Lawson.

_Magical bloodlines, fron Antiquity to today_, by Myrddin Wyllt.

"Not 'History of Hogwarts'?" Kevin asked with a smile.

"All checked out, with a two-week wait," Hermione distractedly answered, opening a book and pointing to a page.
"Take a look."

Kevin sad down and looked at the magical lines.
It was probably a rare, enchanted book, automatically updating itself.
He easily found Slytherin's name and traced the dozens of lines formed by his descendents.
Kevin frowned when he realized that all but one of his heirs died.
And the remaining name did not please him.

"Hermione, did you read this book?" Kevin asked.

The young girl lifted her head from her reading, pushed back a few strands of her hair behind her ear while shaking her head.
Kevin turned the book towards her, and Hermione slowly followed the line the Ravenclaw pointed to her, before suddenly growing pale.

"That's..."

"Shush," Kevin whispered, looking behind her.
Theodore Nott and Daphe Greengrass sliently arrived, followed by Blaise Zabini, who was as exuberant as ever.
Kevin softly turned the pages to not show this line, and accidently found the page for the Weasleys.
Amused, he showed Hermione, who softly laughed when she noticed that it was an old line, decending from the Malfoys.
And to think that Ronald's resentment towards Draco was growing stronger as time passed, because Draco did not lose an occasion to annoy him...
Did the Gryffindor know they were distant relatices?

"Hello," Theo smiled, reading over Hermione's shoulder.
"May we?"

"Of course," Kevin answered, getting back the book his hands to continue reading it calmly."

"You found a book written by Merlin?" Blaise said, impressed, reading the title of the grimoire as he pushed a rather wobbly pile of books to fit on the table.

"Merlin?" Kevin asked, surprised.

Theo laughed softly, and looked at the two Muggle-Bornds.

"You know, quite a lot of Slytherins like you.
You accept our House without much problems, and you are so in the know of our traditions that we always forget you are Muggle-Borns."

"You don't hate Mudbloods?" Hermione asked.

"No at all, the main problem is the lack of adaptation and acceptation of our society's customs.
Frankly, just notice the reactions from the duel...
Most Muggle-Borns, and even a few Half-Bloods, were disgusted.
But when you ask any Pure-Blood, they'll say that a duel, especially as regulated as it was, and supervised by arbiters and aurors, is perfectly acceptable," Daphe said softly.

"To get back to the initial discussion, Merlin's real name was Myrddin Wyllt, and books from his  hand are rare, all the more if they are enchanted," Theo said.
"Are you interested by magical lineages?"

"We're curious", Hermione vaguely answered.

"Of course, it has nothing to do with this thing about an heir," Blaise said with a smile.

"Of course," Kevin nodded.

"By the way, Vlad was not in Charms lecture," Daphne declared.
"I hope he's okay!"

"He left school for the day.
He has family matters to take care of," Kevin avoided answering directly, as he did not have a reason to explain the Russian tradition of the day of the dead to the Slytherins.
They did not care to know more, like a Gryffindor would have done, and focused on their homework, while the Ravenclaw went away to put away numerous volumes.
The Kemenovs were one of the most influent clans in Russia, its heir probably had strong familial obligations...

<hr>

And the Slytherins, as was Kevin, were not far from the truth.
After spending part of the day talking with Katya about the clan's affaires, Vladmir was sitting on his parents grave, accompanied by Katya, Sergei... and Lucius Malfoy.
The latter, distinguished in his ceremony robe, was pinching his lips while downing his glass of Pure-Ice vodka after the communion with the deceased
This ceremony had impressed him, especially the powerful wave of pure magic coming from the grave at the end, but he did not seem to appreciate the Russian national drink as much as the other three.

"My dear," he said, attentively observing Katya while Vlad broke the bread and was passing it to Lucius.
"As much as I am honoured to take part in such an important event as the celebration of the deceased, I highly doubt you invited me only by friendship.
If friendship can define our relationship..."

"I think we can consider each other as an ally at first," the Kemenov matriarch smiled," but you are not wrong.
We are meeting here for a reason.
This cemetary is free from eavesdroppers, as one can only come here if accompanied by a relative of one of the people buried here..."

"Did Draco inform you of our discussion with one of your family's elves?" Vlad asked, softly swirling the end of his glass of vodka.

"He has," Lucius became gloomy.

Indeed, his son had informed him of the presence of his wife in Russia, although she had told him she would go to the Mauxfois, the French family branch.
Narcissa had deliberatly lied to him, but he was waiting before making her understand that you don't betray a Malfoy.

"What do you know exactly about..."


"It's family matters," the Lord cut short.

"No, it isn't," Vlad softly responded.
Lucius looked at him, surprised that his aunt let him finish the rest of his glass of vodka without saying anything -- Russians definitely were alcoholics -- and looked into the green eyes of the young boy.

"Draco did not tell you anyhting, considering that it was possible your wife intercepted the letter," Katya declared, leaning on the Potters' tomb.

Lucius stayed silent, waiting for the woman to tell him more, thinking about her words.
A few months beofre, Draco would never have imagined that Narcissa could read the letter he sent to him, although she regularly did.
The Lord realised his son was growing up, and that was not to his displeasure.

"Ilyna Saprovna Dolohov, and Felix Demetrovitch Darerine...
Do you know those names?"

"Unfortunately, I do," Lucius nodded.
"Felix was Voldemort's necromancer during the war.
He gave him most of the Inferis.
He fled to Russia when the Dark Lord disappeared.
As for Ilyna...
She was the Lord's lietenant in Eastern Europe...
I think she went to her family's castle in Estonia.

"I did not know he was in contact with Slavic families," Vlamdir whispered for himself.
Lucius heard him, however, and sighed before responding.
