# Chapter 36: A new year

Hermione looked anxiously at the enormous clock on Platform 9 3/4 before looking back at her friends.
She distractedly scratched the impressive ginger cat sitting on her shoulders, nibbling at her lips.
After two other nervous looks at the time, she saw the students starting to get in the red carriages of the Hogwarts Express.

"Has anyone hear from Vlad?" she enventually asked as most students had already disappeared into the train.

"None," Draco answered neutrally, looking at his father.
He knew him well enough to notice the spark of worry in the Malfoy patriarch's eyes.
And judging from Augusta Longbottom's behaviour, the way that she was fiddling with her horrible taxidermied hat to 'straighten it up' was also a sign of nerviousness.

"Not since the trial," Neville sighed, who had also noticed his grandmother's worry.

Not since the trial...
Neville grimaced, remmebering the headlines the day after.
'Albus Dumbledore, a Biased Headmaster', 'Meddling in the Life of Hogwarts Students', 'Hogwars, Safest School in the British Isles? Not for Muggle-Born Students', 'Sacking and Reforms for Hogwarts' were some of the featured headlines during the following few days.
Fortunately, Vladmir had disappeared, avoiding the harsh attacks from a particularly virulent journalist named Rita Skeeter.
Katya had probably done something, because the Daily Prophet journalist had stopped her insinuations overnight.
But the harm had been done...

"He will be here," Kevin eventually sighed, reaching out to pet Hermione's cat.
"Is it a Kneazle?"

"Half-Kneazle," Hermione answered, distracted.
"My parents give him to me for my birthday, slightly early."

"Yeah, it's soon...
They are very intelligent beasts," Kevin smiled.
"And very loyal, at that."

"They jsut tend to leave hairs everywhere.
Get your mop away from me," Draco groaned.
"I don't want my robes to be covered by this ugly colour."

"Ginger is pretty!" Hermione protested.

"I think it reminds him of the Weasleys and Gryffindors," Neville laughed, looking at Kevin.
The Muggle-Born had managed to slightly ease the heavy atmosphere, as Hermione and Draco were amicably arguing.

"What's his name?"

"Crookshanks.
The shop assistant said that he had stayed in the pet shop for a long time."

"Not surprising," Draco sniffed.
"Have you seen his muzzle?
He must have run into a wall!"

Crookshanks looked at him in contempt, while Hermione pinched her lips, her hazel eyes trying to strike the young noble.

Greatly amusing Neville and Kevin, they both continued to heckle with each other.
The Ravenclaw frowned when the train's whistle rang out, anouncing the impending departure of the Hogwart's Express.
But where was Vlad?

A chimney activated as the last parents hugged their children and two people got out.
No one wanted to point out that the Kemenovs were late or how much they had worried.
Not after they saw their faces.

Katya was clenching her teeth so hard that her jaws were white, and her eyes was throwing daggers, while Vlad was wearing his polar mage face.
The temperature dropped a few degrees as the Russian boy simply nodded to greet everyone.
He did not say goodbye to his aunt before getting on the train, outright ignoring her.

His friends, surprised, jumped on the train after him, just in time.
As soon as Kevin had stepped foot on the step, the Hogwarts Express started to move.
The small group of friends grabbed onto the walls to avoid falling.
Kevin, just before entering the train, looked at his friends' parents and saw a tear drop on Katya's cheek.

Something bad had happened at the Kemenovs'.

The Hogwarts Express rapidly sped up, while the Alliance core observed Vlamdir.
The young Russian still had not unclenched his teeth, leaning against the wall, and he had not answered their greetings.

After the train reached its crusing speed, they started to look for an empty compartment.
They looked into each one they passed, but they unfortunately could not find an empty one, as they were the last in.
They eventually got into the only one with one occupant.

Vladmir, still thoughtful, sat down next to the windows, and mulled over his dark thoughts.
His friends, however, were looking at the unknown man.
It was the first adult that they saw traveling in the Hogwarts Express, and all were extremely curious.

"Who do you think this is?" Neville whispered, closing the door of the compartement.

"Our new Defence Against the Dark Arts professor," Draco hazarded, looking at the sleeping man with curiosity.
He disdainfully graimaced at the patched up robes and the man's pale skin, but he did not comment.

"This is Professor R.J. Lupin," Hermione whispered, pointing at the old suitcase in the luggage rack.

"Lupin?" Vladmir groaned, finally deigning to open his mouth.
He squinted his eyes, observing the man wearily.

"Vlad.
Are you alright?" Kevin carefully asked, happy to see his friend unclench his teeth.
Even if he had only been silent for a quarter of an hour, his state of mind was contagious, and made the atmosphere heavy.

The Russian shrugged, still staring at Professor Lupin.

"He's aged quickly," Vladmir eventually responded, pointing at their future teacher.

"Do you know him?"

"He was one of my father's friends.
But he did'nt have white hair, and didn't look like he was dying in Katya's memories..."

"He's sick."

Draco simply stated a fact.
One had to admit that the man's deathly tone, as well as the large bags under his eyes were quite the clue about his health.

"Seems like it," the Russian succintly said.

A heavy silence fell in the cabin once again until a long appeasing purr was heard.
They all looked down at the impressive fur ball on Hermione's knees.
Crookshanks seemed quite happy to get belly rubs from both Muggle-Borns.

"Does it have something to do with Black?" Kevin asked without looking away from his friend's half-Kneazle.

"Yes," Vlamdir sighed after a few seconds and a privacy charms cast on the future Professor.

"Katya told me he might have been innocent," he continued.
"According to her, there might not have been a trial.
And Lucius says he never saw him in the Death Eaters meetings."

"It would not be surprising.
My father was You-Know-Who's right-hand man.
However, even if he knew most followers, traitors and spies were only known of the Dark Lord.
Father only knew about Severus."

"And would our favourite Potions Professor know who his estimated treason colleagues were?" Neville asked with a touch of humour.

Draco groaned in response.
Vlamdir, forehead on the glass, looked at the increasingly heavy rain.

"Why are you so angry?" Hermione asked warily.

"I want to avenge my parents," Vladmir whsipered, not looking away from the sad and desolate landscape.
"I want it since Katya explained to be how they died.
Black was their Secret Keeper.
Voldemort found them only because he betrayed them.
Because of him, I lost my parents, and without Katya..."

Without Katya, he would have ended up at the Durselys'.
Without Katya, he would have never been informed of the wizarding world before his eleventh birthday, knowing his maternal aunt.
Without Katya, he would have been at Dumbledore's mercy...
But above all, without Sirius Black, his parents would have lived, and they would have been with him on the Hogwarts Express quay...
Vlamdir bit his lips to hold back tears.
In anger, he had said things... things that Katya did not deserve...
They had vilently argued, just before going to the station, and Vladmir deeply regretted his words.

His friends did not try to know more and left him alone.
Hermione opened a book about the ancient wizarding traditions while the boys took a wizarding strategy game called "Wars and Treason". the young lioness, interested, quickly stopped reading to look at the board.
Since it was enchanted, it had grown to form a huge terrain that was randomly generated.
Looking over Draco's shoulder, she gathered that the cards they held in hand gave him war potions and the ability to learn a piece of information about Kevin's forces thanks to a 'traitor' card.

As they were absorbed by the game, they did not notice the Trolley witch pass by, nor some students peek inside, looking for their friends.
One thing, however, made them leave the game...
The ginger twins' arrival, proudly wearing the Gryffindor emblem on their school robes.

"We're seeking asylum!" Fred exclaimed, sitting down next to Draco.

"Weasleys, you should both learn some manners!"

"_Heretem_ Malfoy, would you please welcome us in your very close circle, for the duration of our hiding from our older brother?" George asked, making a perfect bow, which surprised Draco.
Knowing the Weasleys, it was surprising to see them know etiquette this well.
He always forgot they were a noble family when he looked at its members...

"I might, _Minorem_ Weasley.
You are welcome."

"_Heretem_, _Minorem_," Kevin noted.

"They are ranks in a noble family," Neville explained as George joined his twin.
They were starting to be hemmed in, especially since they tried not to step on their future Professor's toes.

"The elder is the heir, more rarely called _Heretem_.
The second-born boy, who can inherit a secondary title, is called _Seniorem_.
The others are _Minorem_.
The last-born is a _Minem_," Hermione declared learnedly with a smile.

"Where did you find that information?" Kevin wondered.

Hermione showed him the book she was reading before following the "Wars and Treasons" game.

"Who's that?" Fred asked, pointing to Lupin.

"A teacher?" his twin guessed.

"Yep.
Don't worry, Vlad has cast a privacy charm on him.
You were hiding from Percy?" Neville asked.

"Yeah!
He hasn't stopped since he learned that he is Head Boy.
You realize..."

"That he took his badge..."

"With him in Egypt?"

"And you didn't put him in a pyramid?" Hermione asked maliciously.

"We tried, but..."

"... Mom realised and..."

"... Bill got him out before..."

"... he was mummified..."

"... unfortunately!" George concluded with a theatrical sigh.

"And he is running after you to dissuade you from doing pranks this year," Kevin understood.

"Unlucky..."

"... he will be the first..."

"... on our list!"


Draco, who was surveilling the outside of the compartment, declared taht the coast was clear after he saw the new Head Boy walk passed.
With a relieved smile, the Weasley twins stood up.

"Vlad, tomorrow evening at the HQ?" Fred asked seriously on the door step.

Vlamdir, who hadn't uttered a word since they arrived, simply nodded.

"And guys...
Bring him."

George turned towards the Russian and attentively observed him before nodding.

The small groups, guessing that Vladmir would not answer their questions, simply continued the game.
This time, Vlamdir intently looked at the game, until some strident noised perturbed them.
They all looked up at Vladmir's suitcase, from where the sound came.
The Russian stood up to quickly rummage through his trunk and got out the pocket Sneakoscope Sergei had offered him for his birthday.
It had activated near Mad-Eye Moody on Diagon Alley, and it was now clearly in alert mode.
It turned and shone in his palm.

"Is it a real one?" Neville asked, frowning.

"Yes."

It was enough for the two Pure-Bloods to become tense.
Sneakoscopes don't react to nothing.

"Weird..." the Russian whispered for himself, wrapping his fingers on the small magical object.
Kevin, now used to picking up on his friend's every comment after two years of life with him in Ravenclaw, heard him.

"What's wrong Vlad?" he asked, noticing the Russian's posture and his attentive eyes.

Vlad turned his head to the outside, and looked at the landscape go by.
The weather was increasingly bad, and the air smelled like...

**"Fear.
The air stinks of fear..."**, Vladmir murmured, forwning even more.
"Something approaches..." he added for his friends.

"Vlad?" Hermione whispered, as Kevin imitated Draco and Neville, subconsciently tensing uo.
They could feel anxiety churn at their stomachs.
Indeed, something evil was coming.

Their wands left their holsters to reach their hands, although not their official wands...
Kevin was firmly holding Gilderoy Lockhart's former wand, who did not need it since his body was found in the Thames with thanks form the Irish Court.

Neville slowly moved his wrist to adapt to his father longer and more rigid wand.
As for Draco, he had apparently got his hand on the Molfoy's famous Light wand.
The artefact had been handed down from father to son for centuries, his family amused by the name for a line usually asociated to the Dark.

Even Hermione had managed to slip into Knockturn Alley to get a wand without the Trace to practice during the summer.

The light of the compartment slightly flickered and an uncomfortabe cold flowed in as the train was slowly decelerating.
A few minutes afterwards, the Hogwarts Express stopped with a last grinding of the wheels.

The four membres of the Alliance stood up, worried, and Hermione invoked a powerful flame to get some light.
They hesitated to go in the corridor to see what was happening, when Draco saw fog appearing and windows freeze.

"Dementors!" he understood, growing pale.

"Are you sure?" Neville grimaced.

"I think we'll discover it soon," Vladmir whispered, pointing to the huge silhouette behind the door.
All felt a shiver of fear.

The door opened slowly, and the cold felt even more biting as a hooded figure was approaching them.
All colour drained from Vladmir's face.
However, he was not the only affected one.
All the group felt their positive thoughts drain away as the cold froze them to their core.

"Vlad felt his mind grow numb.
Terrifed yells and childish sobs rang out in his head.
Sobs he had heard before and that brought him too far into his memories.
He felt his whole body in fear and his ears hum.

"... mir..."

Vlamdir opened his eyes, which he had not realised that he had closed.
He didn't feel himself fall either, but he was now on the ground.
Hermione, kneeling before him, had just taken his hand into her own.
To his great surprise, while most people became cold near Dementors, Vlad realised that his friend's skin was hot.
He feebly smiled to reassure her, and Hermione stood up to courageously walk in front of the guardians of Europe's biggest wizarding prison.
As if immune from their effects, the young licorine pretected her friends from the creature's magic.

"Get out," a sore voice rang out.
"No one is hiding Sirius Black under their cape."

Professor Lupin had finally woken up and seemed fit, if you looked past the enormous purple under his eyes.
The Dementor did not seem to hear, its attention focused on Hermione.
A scrawny hand raised to touche the young girl's cheek with a strange tenderness.
The new Professor whispered a few words and an impressive ball of light sprang from his wand.
It forced the creature to leave the compartment and light and heat quickly came back.

"Wow, what was that Professor Lupin?" Kevin asked, curious, after a few seconds of silence.

The man gave him a strage look.
He seemed to be unsettled by the young Ravenclaw's curiosity but answered him, starting at Kevin with his amber eyes.

"A Dementor," the man said.

"No, I know that," Kevin brushed away with his hand nonchalantly.
"I was talking about your spell."

"Patronus," Neville, Draco and Vladmir simultaneously answered with a muffled voice.

The man gave looked at the three students warily.
Vladmir, still on the ground, held his head between his knees to avoid collapsing, Hermione to his side.

"What year are you in?" he asked.
"And how do you know my name, by Merlin?"

"Has any one got chocolate?" Vlad feebly asked, ignoring the question.

Lupin had a pale smile as he saw the sorry looks from the youngsters, and rummaged through his pockets to get a chocolate bar from  it.
He started to break it into pieces to distribute it between the students.

"I had wanted to give this chocolate bar to Professor McGonagall, but you need it more than her.
You didn't answer my question," he continued a few moments later, after the chocolate took effect.

"We are starting our third year, and as for your name..."

"... it is simply..."

"... on your suitcase..." Vladmir completed, standing up, slightly more at ease.
He winked at Kevin, getting dramatic sighs from his friends.

"Gemini, stop it," Draco asked with a false lassitude, even though he was internally laughing at the perplexed expression of their future Professor.
"At least waint until we get to Hogwarts for that."

"What?"

"It's not our fault if..."

"...the answer to..."

"... this question was..."

"...so easy!"

"We just make our logical mind works, as the good eagles we are!"

"Oi!
Let me remind you that Hermione was the one who saw the suitcase!" Draco pointed out.

Vladmir frowned as the saw Lupin's sudden reaction.
The man had not paid attention to Hermione.
She was always the most discreet of the group, even though she was in reality the most powerful thanks to her magical creature nature.
However, when the amber eyes turned towards her, Vlad saw Lupin's pupils shrink in surprise, and he hear him discreetly sniff the air.

Remus Lupin was a magical created, which he had never seen on his father's memories.
He only had to find out which one...

"How do yo uknow the Dementors and the Patronus charm?" the man asked after a few seconds of silence.
"It's only in the seventh year curriculum."

"We are Pure-Bloods, Professor," Draco said smugly.
"We known what Dementors looks like, contrary to Muggle-Borns and Half-Bloods."

Professor Lupin frowned at the evident scorn from young Draco for 'impure' Bloods."
He observed him attentively.

The young boy was the spitting image of his father, and Lupin could not mistake him for anybody else.
He realised that the bushy-haired Gryffindor and the blue-eyed Ravenclaw must be Pure-Bloods as well.
On the other hand, it was obvious that the Malfoy heir would not get mixed with mere Muggle-Borns.

Continuing his observation, he saw that Neville Longbottom had slighlty lowered his eyes.
He also looked a lot like his father.
Franck had been chubby-cheeked as well in his youth.
Apparently the young Neville did not share Draco Malfoy's ideology, but did not hae enought self-confidence to defend his opinion...

Remus Lupin never noticed that Draco had used 'Muggle-Born', instead of 'Mudblood'.
What shocked Lupin, however, was the lack of reaction from his late best friend's son.
Harry Potter had not reacted to Malfoy's unpleasant remarks, and clearly thought himself a Pure-Blood.

Lupin wondered who could have raised him like this.
It was on this train of thought that he declared to the students that he would go talk to the drive and come back a few minutes after.

"He judged us all," Neville suddenly groaned as the door closed behind their future Professor.

"That's to be expected, you took back the shy Gryffindor role," Hermione noted.

"Yeah, but I think he mistook you both for Pure-Bloods, and the gaze he gave Vlad..."

"Why Pure-Bloods?" Kevin wondered.

"What gaze?" Hermione asked at the same time.

They looked at each other, then...

"Our lack of reaction at Draco's words," the young Gryffindor started.
"Any Muggle-Born or Half-Blood would have protested agains the discriminatory words."

"And he looked at Vlad with disappointment," Kevin added.

The three other students looked at him with a smile.

"I was a Half-Blood," Vlad explained.
"But when Katya made a blood adoption, I am a Pure-Blood."

"But blood adoptions keep part of the mother's genes intact, judging from your eyes!" Hermione said.

"How can you be Half-Blood if..."

"In fact, technically, I have three quarters of "pure" blood from both the Potters and the Kemenovs.
The last quarter is Muggle-Born.
It's as if my mother was Half-Blood.
In that case, the blood is considered pure."

"So, if your grandparents are Muggle-Borns, you are a Pure-Blood?"

"Not exactly," Neville sighed.
"It's a bit more complicated...
To be considered a Pure-Blood, you need at least a parent from a wizarding line, and a Half-Blood parent.
If both of your parents are Half-Blood, you'll still be a Half-Blood."

"So if Vlad marries..."

"If Vlad marries a Half-Blood, their children will be 'pure'."

"So Lupin thinks that Vlad is a Half-Blood thinking himself to be a Pure-Blood.
Isn't that frowned upon?"

"Very.
But he is not a Half-Blood."

After a few minutes of debate on Blood statutes, they took a break to change.
They would arrive in Hogwarts less than an hour later...
Hermione got out so that the four boys would change, then they switched for the girl to get into her school robes.
As they were starting to talk about matrimonial contracts, the door flung open.

"Vlad!" a young, blonde, frail girl jumped into the Russian's arms, who somehow managed to catch her.

"Luna? what going on?" Kevin aksed as the Ravenclaw girl was sobbing into Vlad's neck, seeking comfort.
The Russian, stiff, tried to calm her as best as he could.

The young girl enventually let go of Vlad and huddled up between her Housemates, drying her humid eyes.
Hermione understood the cause of her bahaviour from how pale she was.
She gave her her piece of chocolate and took her hand until she calmed down, communicating some comfort.

"Thank you," Luna sighed, delicately biting into the sweet.
Colour grew back into her cheeks, then she put her legs over Vladmir's lap and using Kevin's shoulder as a pillow.
She fell alseep in seconds, under the third years' amused looks.

"Well, that's..."

"That's Luna," Neville smile softly.

"She must have seen her mother's death," Draco sighed, putting his cape over Luna's legs.
Strangely, she had come bare feet, her thin legs only covered by her uniform skirt.

"How do you know?"

"It made the Prophet headlines a few years ago.
I remember, because my mother was also a poitionist, and I was afraid it would happen to her."

"Potions accident?"

"A nasty one at that.
Half of the Lovegood manor went up in flames.
It has stayed abandonned ever since," Neville whispered.

A few minutes later, Professor Lupin came back in the compartment and observed the small group once again.
He seemed surprised when he saw Luna sleeping on her classmates, but did not question it, neither did he question the House pins.
He sat down in his spot and smiled at them when he noticed they all ate their piece of chocolate.

"We'll arrive in ten minutes.
Are you alright Harry?" he added after some hesitation.

"It's Vladmir, Professor," he calmly corrected, not surprised of the use of his former name.
"But I am indeed alright.
Just a few bad memories coming back."

The man had an uneasy smile.

"Why..."

"Why am i not called Harry Potter any more?
My aunt adopted me."
