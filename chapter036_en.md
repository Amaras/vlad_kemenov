# Chapter 36: A new year

Hermione looked anxiously at the enormous clock on Platform 9 3/4 before looking back at her friends.
She distractedly scratched the impressive ginger cat sitting on her shoulders, nibbling at her lips.
After two other nervous looks at the time, she saw the students starting to get in the red carriages of the Hogwarts Express.

"Has anyone hear from Vlad?" she enventually asked as most students had already disappeared into the train.

"None," Draco answered neutrally, looking at his father.
He knew him well enough to notice the spark of worry in the Malfoy patriarch's eyes.
And judging from Augusta Longbottom's behaviour, the way that she was fiddling with her horrible taxidermied hat to 'straighten it up' was also a sign of nerviousness.

"Not since the trial," Neville sighed, who had also noticed his grandmother's worry.

Not since the trial...
Neville grimaced, remmebering the headlines the day after.
'Albus Dumbledore, a Biased Headmaster', 'Meddling in the Life of Hogwarts Students', 'Hogwars, Safest School in the British Isles? Not for Muggle-Born Students', 'Sacking and Reforms for Hogwarts' were some of the featured headlines during the following few days.
Fortunately, Vladmir had disappeared, avoiding the harsh attacks from a particularly virulent journalist named Rita Skeeter.
Katya had probably done something, because the Daily Prophet journalist had stopped her insinuations overnight.
But the harm had been done...

"He will be here," Kevin eventually sighed, reaching out to pet Hermione's cat.
"Is it a Kneazle?"

"Half-Kneazle," Hermione answered, distracted.
"My parents give him to me for my birthday, slightly early."

"Yeah, it's soon...
They are very intelligent beasts," Kevin smiled.
"And very loyal, at that."

"They jsut tend to leave hairs everywhere.
Get your mop away from me," Draco groaned.
"I don't want my robes to be covered by this ugly colour."

"Ginger is pretty!" Hermione protested.

"I think it reminds him of the Weasleys and Gryffindors," Neville laughed, looking at Kevin.
The Muggle-Born had managed to slightly ease the heavy atmosphere, as Hermione and Draco were amicably arguing.

"What's his name?"

"Crookshanks.
The shop assistant said that he had stayed in the pet shop for a long time."

"Not surprising," Draco sniffed.
"Have you seen his muzzle?
He must have run into a wall!"

Crookshanks looked at him in contempt, while Hermione pinched her lips, her hazel eyes trying to strike the young noble.
