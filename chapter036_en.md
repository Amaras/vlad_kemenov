# Chapter 36: A new year

Hermione looked anxiously at the enormous clock on Platform 9 3/4 before looking back at her friends.
She distractedly scratched the impressive ginger cat sitting on her shoulders, nibbling at her lips.
After two other nervous looks at the time, she saw the students starting to get in the red carriages of the Hogwarts Express.

"Has anyone hear from Vlad?" she enventually asked as most students had already disappeared into the train.

"None," Draco answered neutrally, looking at his father.
He knew him well enough to notice the spark of worry in the Malfoy patriarch's eyes.
And judging from Augusta Longbottom's behaviour, the way that she was fiddling with her horrible taxidermied hat to 'straighten it up' was also a sign of nerviousness.

"Not since the trial," Neville sighed, who had also noticed his grandmother's worry.

Not since the trial...
Neville grimaced, remmebering the headlines the day after.
'Albus Dumbledore, a Biased Headmaster', 'Meddling in the Life of Hogwarts Students', 'Hogwars, Safest School in the British Isles? Not for Muggle-Born Students', 'Sacking and Reforms for Hogwarts' were some of the featured headlines during the following few days.
Fortunately, Vladmir had disappeared, avoiding the harsh attacks from a particularly virulent journalist named Rita Skeeter.
Katya had probably done something, because the Daily Prophet journalist had stopped her insinuations overnight.
But the harm had been done...

"He will be here," Kevin eventually sighed, reaching out to pet Hermione's cat.
"Is it a Kneazle?"

"Half-Kneazle," Hermione answered, distracted.
"My parents give him to me for my birthday, slightly early."

"Yeah, it's soon...
They are very intelligent beasts," Kevin smiled.
"And very loyal, at that."

"They jsut tend to leave hairs everywhere.
Get your mop away from me," Draco groaned.
"I don't want my robes to be covered by this ugly colour."

"Ginger is pretty!" Hermione protested.

"I think it reminds him of the Weasleys and Gryffindors," Neville laughed, looking at Kevin.
The Muggle-Born had managed to slightly ease the heavy atmosphere, as Hermione and Draco were amicably arguing.

"What's his name?"

"Crookshanks.
The shop assistant said that he had stayed in the pet shop for a long time."

"Not surprising," Draco sniffed.
"Have you seen his muzzle?
He must have run into a wall!"

Crookshanks looked at him in contempt, while Hermione pinched her lips, her hazel eyes trying to strike the young noble.

Greatly amusing Neville and Kevin, they both continued to heckle with each other.
The Ravenclaw frowned when the train's whistle rang out, anouncing the impending departure of the Hogwart's Express.
But where was Vlad?

A chimney activated as the last parents hugged their children and two people got out.
No one wanted to point out that the Kemenovs were late or how much they had worried.
Not after they saw their faces.

Katya was clenching her teeth so hard that her jaws were white, and her eyes was throwing daggers, while Vlad was wearing his polar mage face.
The temperature dropped a few degrees as the Russian boy simply nodded to greet everyone.
He did not say goodbye to his aunt before getting on the train, outright ignoring her.

His friends, surprised, jumped on the train after him, just in time.
As soon as Kevin had stepped foot on the step, the Hogwarts Express started to move.
The small group of friends grabbed onto the walls to avoid falling.
Kevin, just before entering the train, looked at his friends' parents and saw a tear drop on Katya's cheek.

Something bad had happened at the Kemenovs'.

The Hogwarts Express rapidly sped up, while the Alliance core observed Vlamdir.
The young Russian still had not unclenched his teeth, leaning against the wall, and he had not answered their greetings.

After the train reached its crusing speed, they started to look for an empty compartment.
They looked into each one they passed, but they unfortunately could not find an empty one, as they were the last in.
They eventually got into the only one with one occupant.

Vladmir, still thoughtful, sat down next to the windows, and mulled over his dark thoughts.
His friends, however, were looking at the unknown man.
It was the first adult that they saw traveling in the Hogwarts Express, and all were extremely curious.

"Who do you think this is?" Neville whispered, closing the door of the compartement.

"Our new Defence Against the Dark Arts professor," Draco hazarded, looking at the sleeping man with curiosity.
He disdainfully graimaced at the patched up robes and the man's pale skin, but he did not comment.

"This is Professor R.J. Lupin," Hermione whispered, pointing at the old suitcase in the luggage rack.

"Lupin?" Vladmir groaned, finally deigning to open his mouth.
He squinted his eyes, observing the man wearily.

"Vlad.
Are you alright?" Kevin carefully asked, happy to see his friend unclench his teeth.
Even if he had only been silent for a quarter of an hour, his state of mind was contagious, and made the atmosphere heavy.

The Russian shrugged, still staring at Professor Lupin.

"He's aged quickly," Vladmir eventually responded, pointing at their future teacher.

"Do you know him?"

"He was one of my father's friends.
But he did'nt have white hair, and didn't look like he was dying in Katya's memories..."

"He's sick."

Draco simply stated a fact.
One had to admit that the man's deathly tone, as well as the large bags under his eyes were quite the clue about his health.

"Seems like it," the Russian succintly said.

A heavy silence fell in the cabin once again until a long appeasing purr was heard.
They all looked down at the impressive fur ball on Hermione's knees.
Crookshanks seemed quite happy to get belly rubs from both Muggle-Borns.

"Does it have something to do with Black?" Kevin asked without looking away from his friend's half-Kneazle.

"Yes," Vlamdir sighed after a few seconds and a privacy charms cast on the future Professor.

"Katya told me he might have been innocent," he continued.
"According to her, there might not have been a trial.
And Lucius says he never saw him in the Death Eaters meetings."

"It would not be surprising.
My father was You-Know-Who's right-hand man.
However, even if he knew most followers, traitors and spies were only known of the Dark Lord.
Father only knew about Severus."

"And would our favourite Potions Professor know who his estimated treason colleagues were?" Neville asked with a touch of humour.

Draco groaned in response.
Vlamdir, forehead on the glass, looked at the increasingly heavy rain.

"Why are you so angry?" Hermione asked warily.

"I want to avenge my parents," Vladmir whsipered, not looking away from the sad and desolate landscape.
"I want it since Katya explained to be how they died.
Black was their Secret Keeper.
Voldemort found them only because he betrayed them.
Because of him, I lost my parents, and without Katya..."

Without Katya, he would have ended up at the Durselys'.
Without Katya, he would have never been informed of the wizarding world before his eleventh birthday, knowing his maternal aunt.
Without Katya, he would have been at Dumbledore's mercy...
But above all, without Sirius Black, his parents would have lived, and they would have been with him on the Hogwarts Express quay...
Vlamdir bit his lips to hold back tears.
In anger, he had said things... things that Katya did not deserve...
They had vilently argued, just before going to the station, and Vladmir deeply regretted his words.

His friends did not try to know more and left him alone.
Hermione opened a book about the ancient wizarding traditions while the boys took a wizarding strategy game called "Wars and Treason". the young lioness, interested, quickly stopped reading to look at the board.
Since it was enchanted, it had grown to form a huge terrain that was randomly generated.
Looking over Draco's shoulder, she gathered that the cards they held in hand gave him war potions and the ability to learn a piece of information about Kevin's forces thanks to a 'traitor' card.

As they were absorbed by the game, they did not notice the Trolley witch pass by, nor some students peek inside, looking for their friends.
One thing, however, made them leave the game...
The ginger twins' arrival, proudly wearing the Gryffindor emblem on their school robes.

"We're seeking asylum!" Fred exclaimed, sitting down next to Draco.

"Weasleys, you should both learn some manners!"
