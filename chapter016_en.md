Severus Snape was slowly drinking a glass of Firewhiskey...
He needed quite the tonic.
Albus Dumbledore kept his eyes on him at all times.
Severus had always looked up to him as one of the greatest wizards of his generation.
However, he didn't like what he was discovering.
Losing most of his pretigious title left him bitter...
Even though he kept his sweet-old-man face in public, he was... different to his close circle.

_"I'm sure it's Vladmir Kemenov's fault!"_

_"Albus, come one! He's 11!
How are you even thinking he would be able to cast a Dark Magic spell?"_

_Severus looked daggers at Pomona Sprout.
If she knew the truth, she would be horrified.
But, it was just like Hufflepuffs to see Good in everything._

_"He's Russian, which explains why the spell was not detected," Minerva McGonagall [sournoisement] said._

_Severus barely held back a mocking growl.
How low did the Gryffindor spirit fell.
Lily and her stupid husband were probably rolling in their graves seeing how their dear friend treated their son._

_"I have to protest, Albus.
Mr Kemenov is Russian indeed; however, you came to the conclusion it was a [sortilège de découpe].
This Dark Magic spell is not illegal.
Anybody could have used it without alerting the Ministry.
Furthermore, the necessary power is enormous, as Pomona said.
I think this attack is linked to the Philosopher's Stone."_

_Severus looked at his Ravenclaw colleague with renewed respect.
Maybe eagles and snakes were not as dissimilar as he thought...
Suddenly, he was outraged at seeing the old fuming Headmaster hold Flitwick's gaze before doing the same to him.
He immediately felt the pressure on his mind and thanked Merlin for his Occlumency talent and Goblins' innate resistence, before throwing Albus out of his mind._

Needless to say, the Potions Master lost every bit of respect he previously had for Hogwarts' Headmaster after what he tried to do.
He did not, however, show any of it, and had promissed he would watch Vladmir Kemenov and his Slytherin pupils closely.
As if other students never could use Dark Magic...
Absurd!
Even Dumbledore, as a perfect Gryffindor, had used Dark Arts during his affair with Grnidelwald.

Thus, as time went on, Severus's doubt increased.
Many things happened that he was not aware of.
He felt it, he saw it...
But he didn't understand.
It fascinated and frustrated his to no end.
He tried his hardest to gather the data he had at his disposal.

The core of the issue was undeniably Vladmir Kemenov.
As his father was, he was the centre of the attention.
