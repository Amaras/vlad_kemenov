Severus Snape was slowly drinking a glass of Firewhiskey...
He needed quite the tonic.
Albus Dumbledore kept his eyes on him at all times.
Severus had always looked up to him as one of the greatest wizards of his generation.
However, he didn't like what he was discovering.
Losing most of his pretigious title left him bitter...
Even though he kept his sweet-old-man face in public, he was... different to his close circle.

_"I'm sure it's Vladmir Kemenov's fault!"_

_"Albus, come one! He's 11!
How are you even thinking he would be able to cast a Dark Magic spell?"_

_Severus looked daggers at Pomona Sprout.
If she knew the truth, she would be horrified.
But, it was just like Hufflepuffs to see Good in everything._

_"He's Russian, which explains why the spell was not detected," Minerva McGonagall [sournoisement] said._

_Severus barely held back a mocking growl.
How low did the Gryffindor spirit fell.
Lily and her stupid husband were probably rolling in their graves seeing how their dear friend treated their son._

_"I have to protest, Albus.
Mr Kemenov is Russian indeed; however, you came to the conclusion it was a [sortilège de découpe].
This Dark Magic spell is not illegal.
Anybody could have used it without alerting the Ministry.
Furthermore, the necessary power is enormous, as Pomona said.
I think this attack is linked to the Philosopher's Stone."_

_Severus looked at his Ravenclaw colleague with renewed respect.
Maybe eagles and snakes were not as dissimilar as he thought...
Suddenly, he was outraged at seeing the old fuming Headmaster hold Flitwick's gaze before doing the same to him.
He immediately felt the pressure on his mind and thanked Merlin for his Occlumency talent and Goblins' innate resistence, before throwing Albus out of his mind._

Needless to say, the Potions Master lost every bit of respect he previously had for Hogwarts' Headmaster after what he tried to do.
He did not, however, show any of it, and had promissed he would watch Vladmir Kemenov and his Slytherin pupils closely.
As if other students never could use Dark Magic...
Absurd!
Even Dumbledore, as a perfect Gryffindor, had used Dark Arts during his affair with Grnidelwald.

Thus, as time went on, Severus's doubt increased.
Many things happened that he was not aware of.
He felt it, he saw it...
But he didn't understand.
It fascinated and frustrated his to no end.
He tried his hardest to gather the data he had at his disposal.

The core of the issue was undeniably Vladmir Kemenov.
As his father was, he was the centre of the attention.
The Potions Master nearly sighed.
He knew he was unfair with the kid.
He quickly understood that Kemenov was not James Potter, but he could not give up his grudge easily.
He could *not* forget years of mockery and pranks within a few months.

The Potter son probably was part of a Dark family.
The way he had cast this Dark spell was proof that he had used this kind of magic since birth.
Kemenovs were a Dark family indeed...
James Potter was probably rolling in his grave, Snape sneered.
Russia, and more generally the ex-USSR, was an archaic country, a high place of Dark magic, where the most powerful clans reigned supreme, using as much political power as brute force.
Clan wars were the perfect example.

Severus lift his glass to his lips and noticed his hands were still trembling from the terror he felt.
His meeting with the Kemenov family had been particularly unpleasant...
To face James Potter's more terrifying feminine lookalike and a furious vampire was not a walk in the park.

_"Severus, I do not need to introduce Mr Kemenov's guardians to you.
Lady Kemenov, Knyaz Pokhastovine, let me introduce you to Severus Snape.
He is the one most able to help Vladmir..."_

_A low growl immediately went through the vampire's [retrousées] lips as he showed his fangs, looking more like an animal than... civilized.
Professor Snape thought about the word 'human' for a fraction of a second, but vampires absolutely were not that._

_"Snape's hatred for the Potters is legendary," Katya calmly declared, not showing any effort to stop her friend, who was slowly approaching the wizard.
"And this man has repeatedly shown he still held a grudge against my nephew.
How would he be able to help?"_

_Severus frowned.
The Russian Lady was completely ignoring him.
Were he not present, her behaviour would not be any different.
using the - relative - lack of attention on him, he looked Katya Kemenov more closely, something he did not have time to do the day they met in the Great Hall.
Undeniably a Potter.
A - nearly - perfect copy of James, although thinner and more feminine.
Her face was slightly different: more [anguleux], with the characteristically Slavic high cheeks.
She also seemed more tense and tired than the first time to him...
Before he remembered the clan war.
Vladmir was traumatised by a Muggle-style murder and the death of his family.
His aunt didn't seem to feel anything in particular.
Either she was an exceptional Occlumens, either murder was not unusal for her._

_"Severus has calmed down since the beginning of the year...
He is still one of the best Legilimens right now, apart from Dumbledore and You-Know-Who."_

_Only his perfect mastery of both his body and Mind Arts allowed the Potions Master to stay expressionless when confronted with the sudden coldness in the office and the wave of pure hatred that slipped out of the two Russians at the mere suggestion of the two wizards.
Strangely, he noticed Filius was not uneasy from the sudden Dark aura in his office._

_"This man has been a loyal follower of both, and his alleagence is questionable at best."

_Severus wanted to remind them of his presence, but a dark glance from his colleague made him rethink.
Since when could Filius Flitwick seem as intimidating, sitting in his ridiculous pillows?_

The meeting had ended with ope threats from the two Russians against him, under the Ravenclaw Head's dark gaze.
It was the first time Severus Snape felt uneasy looking into his colleague's typically Goblin black eyes.
