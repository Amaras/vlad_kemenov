Severus Snape was slowly drinking a glass of Firewhiskey...
He needed quite the tonic.
Albus Dumbledore kept his eyes on him at all times.
Severus had always looked up to him as one of the greatest wizards of his generation.
However, he didn't like what he was discovering.
Losing most of his pretigious title left him bitter...
Even though he kept his sweet-old-man face in public, he was... different to his close circle.

_"I'm sure it's Vladmir Kemenov's fault!"_

_"Albus, come one! He's 11!
How are you even thinking he would be able to cast a Dark Magic spell?"_

_Severus looked daggers at Pomona Sprout.
If she knew the truth, she would be horrified.
But, it was just like Hufflepuffs to see Good in everything._

_"He's Russian, which explains why the spell was not detected," Minerva McGonagall [sournoisement] said._

_Severus barely held back a mocking growl.
How low did the Gryffindor spirit fell.
Lily and her stupid husband were probably rolling in their graves seeing how their dear friend treated their son._

_"I have to protest, Albus.
Mr Kemenov is Russian indeed; however, you came to the conclusion it was a [sortilège de découpe].
This Dark Magic spell is not illegal.
Anybody could have used it without alerting the Ministry.
Furthermore, the necessary power is enormous, as Pomona said.
I think this attack is linked to the Philosopher's Stone."_

_Severus looked at his Ravenclaw colleague with renewed respect.
Maybe eagles and snakes were not as dissimilar as he thought...
Suddenly, he was outraged at seeing the old fuming Headmaster hold Flitwick's gaze before doing the same to him.
He immediately felt the pressure on his mind and thanked Merlin for his Occlumency talent and Goblins' innate resistence, before throwing Albus out of his mind._

Needless to say, the Potions Master lost every bit of respect he previously had for Hogwarts' Headmaster after what he tried to do.
He did not, however, show any of it, and had promissed he would watch Vladmir Kemenov and his Slytherin pupils closely.
As if other students never could use Dark Magic...
Absurd!
Even Dumbledore, as a perfect Gryffindor, had used Dark Arts during his affair with Grnidelwald.

Thus, as time went on, Severus's doubt increased.
Many things happened that he was not aware of.
He felt it, he saw it...
But he didn't understand.
It fascinated and frustrated his to no end.
He tried his hardest to gather the data he had at his disposal.

The core of the issue was undeniably Vladmir Kemenov.
As his father was, he was the centre of the attention.
The Potions Master nearly sighed.
He knew he was unfair with the kid.
He quickly understood that Kemenov was not James Potter, but he could not give up his grudge easily.
He could *not* forget years of mockery and pranks within a few months.

The Potter son probably was part of a Dark family.
The way he had cast this Dark spell was proof that he had used this kind of magic since birth.
Kemenovs were a Dark family indeed...
James Potter was probably rolling in his grave, Snape sneered.
Russia, and more generally the ex-USSR, was an archaic country, a high place of Dark magic, where the most powerful clans reigned supreme, using as much political power as brute force.
Clan wars were the perfect example.

Severus lift his glass to his lips and noticed his hands were still trembling from the terror he felt.
His meeting with the Kemenov family had been particularly unpleasant...
To face James Potter's more terrifying feminine lookalike and a furious vampire was not a walk in the park.

_"Severus, I do not need to introduce Mr Kemenov's guardians to you.
Lady Kemenov, Knyaz Pokhastovine, let me introduce you to Severus Snape.
He is the one most able to help Vladmir..."_

_A low growl immediately went through the vampire's [retrousées] lips as he showed his fangs, looking more like an animal than... civilized.
Professor Snape thought about the word 'human' for a fraction of a second, but vampires absolutely were not that._

_"Snape's hatred for the Potters is legendary," Katya calmly declared, not showing any effort to stop her friend, who was slowly approaching the wizard.
"And this man has repeatedly shown he still held a grudge against my nephew.
How would he be able to help?"_

_Severus frowned.
The Russian Lady was completely ignoring him.
Were he not present, her behaviour would not be any different.
using the - relative - lack of attention on him, he looked Katya Kemenov more closely, something he did not have time to do the day they met in the Great Hall.
Undeniably a Potter.
A - nearly - perfect copy of James, although thinner and more feminine.
Her face was slightly different: more [anguleux], with the characteristically Slavic high cheeks.
She also seemed more tense and tired than the first time to him...
Before he remembered the clan war.
Vladmir was traumatised by a Muggle-style murder and the death of his family.
His aunt didn't seem to feel anything in particular.
Either she was an exceptional Occlumens, either murder was not unusal for her._

_"Severus has calmed down since the beginning of the year...
He is still one of the best Legilimens right now, apart from Dumbledore and You-Know-Who."_

_Only his perfect mastery of both his body and Mind Arts allowed the Potions Master to stay expressionless when confronted with the sudden coldness in the office and the wave of pure hatred that slipped out of the two Russians at the mere suggestion of the two wizards.
Strangely, he noticed Filius was not uneasy from the sudden Dark aura in his office._

_"This man has been a loyal follower of both, and his alleagence is questionable at best."

_Severus wanted to remind them of his presence, but a dark glance from his colleague made him rethink.
Since when could Filius Flitwick seem as intimidating, sitting in his ridiculous pillows?_

The meeting had ended with ope threats from the two Russians against him, under the Ravenclaw Head's dark gaze.
It was the first time Severus Snape felt uneasy looking into his colleague's typically Goblin black eyes.
Severus pinched the bridge of his nose and his lips together when he thought about an additional element.
He tried drinking a new mouthful of alcohol before he realised his glass was empty.
Filius Flitwick had talked with Vladmir Kemenov in Gobledegook to make sure Severus didn't hear part of their exchange.
Filius Flitwick didn't flinch when feeling Katya Kemenov's Dark aura.
Filius Flitwick didn't seem to mind the threats he had witnessed...
As if all of this was completely normal.

Severus Snape then understood that the small Goblin knew more than he let seem, and that he knew nothing of his past, or Goblin culture for that matter.

Sighing, he put his glass back on his desk, straightened his robes, and looked at the time.
He was supposed to meet Vladmir and Filius for the first session in less than an hour to help the Russian boy reconstruct his Occlumency defenses.
He had been clear on one point: he would not be a therapist.
That Pott... Kemenov went to Pomfrey of his Head of House for this, Severus didn't care, just not to him.
As an incredibly helpful man, he would help close the pupil's mind, but that would be it, as surely as he was named Severus Snape!

However, when he arrived in the boy's mind, Severus could tell that a bit of advice would be beneficial.
As usual, he hadn't messed around and had barked at the student to have him sit down as soon as Severus had entered the office of the Ravenclaw Head of House.
Vladmir Kemenov had obeyed.
He looked better, the last of his bandaged were gone, and he had gotten his haughty and blank expression the Potions Master hated so much.

Unsurprisingly, Severus had easily penetrated Vladmir's mind.
He didn't expect any mental defense.
After all, if he was as good an Occlumensas Filius had told him, the boy wouldn't have given in so easily.  

Except instead of seeing the usual mess of thoughts and memories that most wizards and witches' minds were made of, Severus appeared in a library.
It was perfectly in order, gigantic, and contained numerus traps, Severus was sure.
It was the work of a Master...
However, this piece of work was making him feel [nauséux].
Severus, as a spy with a dark past, as a spy who saw and committed atrocities, understood the Ravenclaw's [mal-être].

This undeniable masterpiece of Mind Arts was covere in blood.
Books, floors, the shelves... everything was covered - probably fresh - blood.
Severus got closer to a book and touched the cover, seeing his hand covered in red.
Fresh indeed... it was obvious, since the memory of the fight was quite recent.

"Mr Kemenov?" Severus called.
He guessed that the library hid several rooms and was too big for him to even hope to find the boy on his own.

"Here, Professor."

Severus turned around and froze for a fraction of a second.
He immediately got his thoughts back in order.
Between two rows of shelves, a small, discreet door was open.
Vladmir was standing inside it - or rather the Vladmir from that fateful fay.
The Slavic clothes were ripped in several places.
Blood was leaking from several cuts, probably thanks to cutting and dissection spells, considering the surgical precision of some of the wounds.
One of the boy's legs seemed broken in several places and the flesh seemed [écrasée].
However, the thing that had caught Severus's attention was his pupil's left arm, which was [pendre] lifelessly.
The arm that had been in bandages for weeks.
The sleeve showed a piece of burnt and naked flesh.
Somebody had probably got the time to immobilise and torture the boy...
