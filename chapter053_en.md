## Chapter 53: The First Task

**"When do you plan on talking to Augusta and Neville?"** Vladmir asked softly, looking at Sergei.

The vampire was nonchalantly lying on the low wall of the Neva quays, fully ignoring the passers-by that looked at the strange pair.
The former was yearningly looking at the snowflakes falling over him and the Saint-Petersburg river, wearing a mere leather jacket.
Vladmir, for his part, was leaning over the wall, hands deep in the pockets of his wollen jacket, nose deep in the fur lining the collar.

The only sign of the psychological malaise that the heir Kemenov had was the paleness of his skin, more visible than ever, as well as the dark circles around his eyes.
The way that the clan was protecting him also showed any attentive observer that the young man lived quite the hardship.
Apart form that, Vlamdir was still as smily with his friends, even if in his head he was continually ruminating, making him more suspicious of people outside of his close circle.

**"Tomorrow,"** Sergei replied, looking at his protégé, noticing his features grow tenser.
The Dark Mage had told clan Kemenov that the Horcrux had done serious damage to Vladmir's confidence, and had made unconscious fears more evident.
The young heir would need time to get back to some kind of a balanced mind.

**"I also want to go to Saint-Mungo.
Even if I have a grudge against Augusta, Neville is an adorable kind, and he makes me think of you so much.
He deserves to have his parents with him."**

Vladmir simply nodded, groaning unconsciously at the name of the Lonbgottom matriarch.
Neville was, after Kevin, his closest friend in Hogwarts, and he deserved to know his parents.

**"Is Grigori coming with you?"**

**"He is.
He wants to know how much Franck and Alice are hiding away in thir mainds and what perception they have…
Or maybe they don't have, of the outside world.
He has called it a magic traumatic syndrome.
It is probable that they took refuge so far into their mind to bear the torture that they got lost inside themselves."**

**"It would be good if they had some kind of awareness of their environment,"** Vladmir murmurred.
**"Neville regularly talks to them about his day.
They would have followed their son's life, and would not be too shocked to see him so old."**

**"Are you okay?"** Sergei asked suddenly.

**"Better,"** the young Kemenov heir nodded slowly.
**"Looking back, I feel…
Ashamed to have doubted Katya and let myself fall into those unreasonable fears."**

Vladmir smiled as he felt a split tongue brush his wrist to comfort him.
He had left Sasssha in the Kemenov palace since the beginning of the year, but after what had happened to him, the small ice viper had premptorily declared that she would not let her human alone.
As soon as she was not there, he got into trouble!
Plus, she wanted to enjoy the company of her children…

**"Your fears were meaningful,"** Sergei reassured him softly.
**"Even if, as you said, you had no reason to doubt Katya, the ectoplasm used your deepest fears.
He has somewhat manipulated you.
When you get your hand on him, keep me a bite."**

The vampire's tone of voice was ironic, but the hatred flowing from his every pore was raw and sincere.
He looked at his protégé, who was distractedly petting Sasssha and ignoring the Muggles around them looking at him, curious.

**"What will you face tomorrow?"** the vampire suddenly asked.

**"A dragon.
Charlie told me that a reservation from Eastern Europeran countries would send dragons to Scotlad for the Tournament.
Apparently, it's quite the gossip in their world.
As soon as he has learned that I was participating against my will, he contacted me.
He didn't tell me what exactly the task would be, though,"** the young Russian grimaced.

**"Would be too easy then,"** Sergei jeered.
**"Did you tell the others?"**

**"We are working on our strategy with Cedric, and he managed to tell Fleur Delacour.
I told Aleksei in a letter, and he should also tell the Rochefroide guy."**

**"You know you are supposed to be competitors?"** the vampire said with a laugh.

**"Yeah, but a dragon…
Sergei!
Can you really imagine yourself facing a Hungarian Horntail without any preparation?"**

Sergei gave him a mocking smile, and Vladmir sighed, remining him that they, the champions, were mere humans, without any vampiric speed or shadow movement.

The two Russians got back to the meditative silence, Sergei returned back to observing the snowflakes, Vladmir looking ate the rare ships brave enough to face the partially frozen waters of the Neva.

Eventually, Sergei and Katya, before returning in Scotland in the early afternoon, dragged him around the magical quarter of Saint-Petersburg.
More precisely, they went to one of the old bars on Palace Square, where they used to go when Katya was still working as an Auror in the Ministry for Magic.
It was located right in front of the entrace to the local branch of the Russian Government, and Vladmir and his guardian of the day would come to wait for Katya's shift to end.
This little routine had gone on until the clan Patriarch, Vassili Kemenov, died.
The witch had then taken the reigns of the clan and Vassili's position in the Semirov, and could not juggle all three responsibilities.

The morning was full of laughter, meeting back former colleagues of his aunt.
All were surpried to see that the young man was so tall, even if they regularly caught up on his news.
He was also bombarded with questions on the Tri-Wizard Tournament.
While Durmstrang was Belarussian, it was still the main boarding school for students in Western Russia.
The news of the presence of two Russians in a mythical competition had gone all round the country, even of one was competing for Hogwarts.

<hr>

Because of the warm atmosphere in Russia, the return to Hogwarts was difficult.
Vladmir did not want to compete in the tournament, but Cedric
