**Russian**
`Parsletongue`

## Chapter 18: Back in Russia

"Ready, Neville?"

The young Longbottom grumbled, dragging his belongings in Hogsmead's station.
Only Vladmir and him had lugage.
They did not take the Hogwarts Express, but rather went through a Portkey directly to Russia.
The Gryffindor sighed when he put down his trunk, and tried to sit on his friend's.
However, he suddenly jumped back and screamed.

"Merlin Vlad, there's a snake on your trunk!"

"Don't worry, it's Sasha!" Kevin exclamied, scratching the small Ice Viper. `Hi Sssasha.`

`Hi Kevin`, the small blueish viper slithered around his wrist, and Kevin took this opportunity to pamper the snake.

"Sa... Sasha?" Neville stuttered.

"My snake", Vlad said, amused, sitting comfortable on his trunk.

"I thought only cats, owls, rats and owls ware allowed?" Hermione said, slightly surprised.
"How come we didn't see it?"

"I doubt Vlad asked for permission," Kevin smiled.
"However, this little rascal tends to roam the castle at night and sleep during the day.
She rarely goes to lectures with Vlad, and whe she does, she is always in the form of a magical bracelet."

Vlad observed Kevin talk with Sasha.
Parsletongue lessons had worked, and while Kevin's vocabulary was still limited, he could have a conversation with Sasha and other snakes.

"I thought you were Muggle-Born," Neville finally said slowly, frowning.

"Yeah, why?"

"You are a snake charmer.
It's a hereditary _Wizarding_ trait," the Gryffindor insisted.

"No, it isn't," Vlad declared.
"Everyone can learn it.
It's a language like any other.
However, it's indeed more difficult for people who don't have the gift."

"You should avoid using Parsletongue in public," Neville declared after staying silent for a minute.
"It's associated with Dark mages."

"So if I..."

Kevin fell silent and quickly lowered his sleeve on his wrist to hid the small viper.
Hermione and Neville had time to catche a glimpse of the silvery shine from a bracelet bedore Draco arrived, accompanied by his Slytherin friends.

"You are going directly to Russia?" Theodore asked with a smile, seeing the two trunks on the Hogwarts Express platform.

"I am, my aunt got premission from the English Ministry for our departure through an international Portkey from the station."

"For the better," Blaise nodded.
"My mother thinks things will be agitated at King's Cross.
Dumbledore is in probation and he's hanging on to his Headmaster title by a thread, which is not something some people like."

Vlad simply shrugged.
He did not care one bit, and Neville dicreetly smile, a smile that was nothing like the timid face he maintained, but was actually a mocking smile.
Thinking about Albus Dumbledore made him remember the face he pulled the day after Quirell died.
To find the cold corpse of a Death Eater and notice the disappearance of the Philosopher's Stone immediately threw the Professors into a panic.
Fortunately, Sergei immediately left, taking the precious gem with him to give it back to its owner.
They owed Draco a big favour.
He admitted that he found the Stone randomly.
He was leaning on an old mirror during their conversation with the Dark mage, and had looked at his reflexion, seeing himself with the Stone.
He did not really pay attention to the significance of the image, until they got back to the library.

"Your fiance is running towards you, Draco," Kevin calmly noted, sitting on Neville's trunk.
Panic briefly shone inside the Malfoy heir's grey eyes, before he calmly turned towards the girl, who was escorted by two teenagers who were built like tanks, namely Crabbe and Goyle.
The slight grimace on Draco's face evaded no one but the girl.
Pansy Parkinson, a young girl with a square face and strong features, stopped right before him, simping to him after looking at his friends with contempt.
It was true that, apart from the Slytherins, they were all wearing Muggle clothes, which was a strark contrast with the other students' wizarding outfits.

"Dray, what are you doing with Mudbloods and Bloodtraitors?
Come, I've gotten a cabin for us."

Draco softly but firmly got his arm out fo Parkinson's talons, while Hermione frowned.
The yound Muggle-born comptentuously observed the blonde act like a flirt. Eleven years old, and already acting like a prostitute, getting herself all over the young heir, Herione thought.

"Tart," she whispered, making Kevin laugh mockingly.

Neville, blushing to repress his laugh at his friend's remark, had put back his hesitant mask.
His red cheeks looked like embarassement.
Kevin, a sneer on his lips, was stroking his sleeve, under which Sasha was hissing with disgust, despite being in her bracelet form.

`Let me bite the ssscornful, Kevin.
Let me teach her mannersssss!` Sasha said, making even Vladmir sneer.
The Russian boy was observing the young couple, sitting comfortably on his trunk.
The Malfoy heir shook his head.

"Sorry Pansy," he said with a smile that was opposite his words. "I promised my friends I would be with them."

He pointed to the small Slytherin band with a cold smile, and tacitely ordered her to get back to the Hogwarts Express with her two bodyguards.
He had to tell her he would see her during the journey to get some peace, however.
