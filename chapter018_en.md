**Russian**
`Parsletongue`

## Chapter 18: Back in Russia

"Ready, Neville?"

The young Longbottom grumbled, dragging his belongings in Hogsmead's station.
Only Vladmir and him had lugage.
They did not take the Hogwarts Express, but rather went through a Portkey directly to Russia.
The Gryffindor sighed when he put down his trunk, and tried to sit on his friend's.
However, he suddenly jumped back and screamed.

"Merlin Vlad, there's a snake on your trunk!"

"Don't worry, it's Sasha!" Kevin exclamied, scratching the small Ice Viper. `Hi Sssasha.`

`Hi Kevin`, the small blueish viper slithered around his wrist, and Kevin took this opportunity to pamper the snake.

"Sa... Sasha?" Neville stuttered.

"My snake", Vlad said, amused, sitting comfortable on his trunk.

"I thought only cats, owls, rats and owls ware allowed?" Hermione said, slightly surprised.
"How come we didn't see it?"

"I doubt Vlad asked for permission," Kevin smiled.
"However, this little rascal tends to roam the castle at night and sleep during the day.
She rarely goes to lectures with Vlad, and whe she does, she is always in the form of a magical bracelet."

Vlad observed Kevin talk with Sasha.
Parsletongue lessons had worked, and while Kevin's vocabulary was still limited, he could have a conversation with Sasha and other snakes.

"I thought you were Muggle-Born," Neville finally said slowly, frowning.

"Yeah, why?"

"You are a snake charmer.
It's a hereditary _Wizarding_ trait," the Gryffindor insisted.

"No, it isn't," Vlad declared.
"Everyone can learn it.
It's a language like any other.
However, it's indeed more difficult for people who don't have the gift."

"You should avoid using Parsletongue in public," Neville declared after staying silent for a minute.
"It's associated with Dark mages."

"So if I..."

Kevin fell silent and quickly lowered his sleeve on his wrist to hid the small viper.
Hermione and Neville had time to catche a glimpse of the silvery shine from a bracelet bedore Draco arrived, accompanied by his Slytherin friends.

"You are going directly to Russia?" Theodore asked with a smile, seeing the two trunks on the Hogwarts Express platform.

"I am, my aunt got premission from the English Ministry for our departure through an international Portkey from the station."

"For the better," Blaise nodded.
"My mother thinks things will be agitated at King's Cross.
Dumbledore is in probation and he's hanging on to his Headmaster title by a thread, which is not something some people like."

Vlad simply shrugged.
He did not care one bit, and Neville dicreetly smile, a smile that was nothing like the timid face he maintained, but was actually a mocking smile.
Thinking about Albus Dumbledore made him remember the face he pulled the day after Quirell died.
To find the cold corpse of a Death Eater and notice the disappearance of the Philosopher's Stone immediately threw the Professors into a panic.
Fortunately, Sergei immediately left, taking the precious gem with him to give it back to its owner.
They owed Draco a big favour.
He admitted that he found the Stone randomly.
He was leaning on an old mirror during their conversation with the Dark mage, and had looked at his reflexion, seeing himself with the Stone.
He did not really pay attention to the significance of the image, until they got back to the library.

"Your fiance is running towards you, Draco," Kevin calmly noted, sitting on Neville's trunk.
Panic briefly shone inside the Malfoy heir's grey eyes, before he calmly turned towards the girl, who was escorted by two teenagers who were built like tanks, namely Crabbe and Goyle.
The slight grimace on Draco's face evaded no one but the girl.
Pansy Parkinson, a young girl with a square face and strong features, stopped right before him, simping to him after looking at his friends with contempt.
It was true that, apart from the Slytherins, they were all wearing Muggle clothes, which was a strark contrast with the other students' wizarding outfits.

"Dray, what are you doing with Mudbloods and Bloodtraitors?
Come, I've gotten a cabin for us."

Draco softly but firmly got his arm out fo Parkinson's talons, while Hermione frowned.
The yound Muggle-born comptentuously observed the blonde act like a flirt. Eleven years old, and already acting like a prostitute, getting herself all over the young heir, Herione thought.

"Tart," she whispered, making Kevin laugh mockingly.

Neville, blushing to repress his laugh at his friend's remark, had put back his hesitant mask.
His red cheeks looked like embarassement.
Kevin, a sneer on his lips, was stroking his sleeve, under which Sasha was hissing with disgust, despite being in her bracelet form.

`Let me bite the ssscornful, Kevin.
Let me teach her mannersssss!` Sasha said, making even Vladmir sneer.
The Russian boy was observing the young couple, sitting comfortably on his trunk.
The Malfoy heir shook his head.

"Sorry Pansy," he said with a smile that was opposite his words. "I promised my friends I would be with them."

He pointed to the small Slytherin band with a cold smile, and tacitely ordered her to get back to the Hogwarts Express with her two bodyguards.
He had to tell her he would see her during the journey to get some peace, however.

"She's worse than her mother," Daphe murmured, rolling her eyes, as Parkinson walked towards the train.

"I heard quite a few rumours on Annabeth Parkinson," Vald nodded.
"If even only half of it is true, I strongly discourage this union, Draco."

"I know, I have talk talk to father about this during the holidays.
He wanted me to spend time with her before saying what I think about it."

"I doubt the marriage will ever happen," Theodore smiled softly.

A strident whistle announced the Hogwarts Express departure, and they told each other their goodbyes, Kevin even hugging his friends to hide the change of wearer of the bracelet.
Sasha disappeared into Vlad's jumper's collar as students entered the cabins.

Neville and Vladmir, alone on the platform with their heavy trunks, watched as the train started, coughing a thick cloud of smoke.

"This is it," Neville said, standing to stretch.
"We are finally on holidays!"

He got his want out, and with a sharp gesture of his wand, reduced them enough to fit into their pockets.
Unfortunately, he could not use this spell before, as it was too complex for a First year student, especially one that was thought of as a Squib.

Vlamdir laughed a bit at his friends machinations, before getting the official Portkey his aunt sent him, along with his watch.
There was one minute left before it triggered.

Neville stectched his hand to the glass, and smiled, impatient to visit his friend's country.

"We're going to arrive in the Russian Ministry for Magic; I hope it will be orderly enough," Vald said as the Portkey activated.

They felt the usual pull on their stomach and their surroundings changed, becoming a large room lit with magical torches.

**"Portkey number 187-RUR-91 from Hogsmead, arrival at 17:30.
Vladmir Vassilievitch Kemenov.
Neville Frank Longbottom."**

Vladmir and Neville quickly left the circle of runes on the ground and approached the receptionnist.
Neville observed Vladmir get his wand out and point it to the register that the man presented him.
The thick book glowed green before getting its neutral appearance afterwards.
The Gryffinder frowned, but stayed silent.

**"Welcome back in Russia, Heir-Prince Kemenov."** 

While this happened, Neville observed the two men wearing dragon leather and combat cloaks who monitored the people arriving.
Another Portkey brought a group of ten people into the rune circle and those ones were closely watched.

On a sign of his friend, Neville looked back at the clerck and got his wand out himself.
The book glowed with emerald green once again.

"Welcome to Russia, Earl Longbottom.
I hope your stay here will be enjoyable," the Russian man said with a thick Slavic accent.

"What was that?" Neville asked once they go out of the room.

"Routine checks.
To come to Russia by Portkey or Apparition, you need to arrive in one of the Ministry's locations.
They check our identity through our magical fingerprints to check we are indeed the wizards they are expecting.
The circle of runes would have revealed a stowaway and the Aurors would have aprehended them."

"Well, Russians aren't kidding with security.
In England, anybody can create Portkeys as long as they are powerful enough, and there is definitely no control on international arrivals."

Vladmir smiled discreetly and said that it was different in Russia.
Every magical transportation way was monitored...
Except if you called on the Miracle Court.
However, Vladmir did not say this phrase in the middle of the Russian Ministry.
He valued his life a bit too much for that...

It was thus with a young English Pure-Blood in tow that Vladmir traversed the Russian Ministry's St-Petersburg location.
He noticed the differences with the previous year, looking for the results of the collapse of the Muggle USSR.
Apparently, nothing important changed with day-to-day operations.
He still noticed the official decrees creating 15 Ministries associated with the new republics.
His attention was focused on the independance decree of Ukraine, and wondered the impact it would have on the Mirazh.
The Ukrainian branch of the Miracle Court had its territory on several other new republics...
Vladmir stopped thinking about political things and focused back on his friend.

After they walked through numerous corridors and halls, the two boys finally got out of the Ministry, and Neville was surprised to see they got out of a huge palace bordering a river.
He looked back and, stunned, observed the bright yellow frontage on which two things shocked him.
A large plaque was stamped with the official symbol of the Russian Ministry and cyrillic letters, and a flag was fluttering, looking like the ex-USSR one.
Except on the red background the hammer was replaced with a wand, and the sickle with a curved sword.

"It's a chachka," Vladmir declared, following his friend's gaze.
"A traditional Circassian sabre, which has long been part of the Muggle military uniform."
