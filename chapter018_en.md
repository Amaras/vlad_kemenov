`Parsletongue`

## Chapter 18: Back in Russia

"Ready, Neville?"

The young Longbottom grumbled, dragging his belongings in Hogsmead's station.
Only Vladmir and him had lugage.
They did not take the Hogwarts Express, but rather went through a Portkey directly to Russia.
The Gryffindor sighed when he put down his trunk, and tried to sit on his friend's.
However, he suddenly jumped back and screamed.

"Merlin Vlad, there's a snake on your trunk!"

"Don't worry, it's Sasha!" Kevin exclamied, scratching the small Ice Viper. `Hi Sssasha.`

`Hi Kevin`, the small blueish viper slithered around his wrist, and Kevin took this opportunity to pamper the snake.

"Sa... Sasha?" Neville stuttered.

"My snake", Vlad said, amused, sitting comfortable on his trunk.

"I thought only cats, owls, rats and owls ware allowed?" Hermione said, slightly surprised.
"How come we didn't see it?"

"I doubt Vlad asked for permission," Kevin smiled.
"However, this little rascal tends to roam the castle at night and sleep during the day.
She rarely goes to lectures with Vlad, and whe she does, she is always in the form of a magical bracelet."

Vlad observed Kevin talk with Sasha.
Parsletongue lessons had worked, and while Kevin's vocabulary was still limited, he could have a conversation with Sasha and other snakes.

"I thought you were Muggle-Born," Neville finally said slowly, frowning.

"Yeah, why?"

"You are a snake charmer.
It's a hereditary _Wizarding_ trait," the Gryffindor insisted.

"No, it isn't," Vlad declared.
"Everyone can learn it.
It's a language like any other.
However, it's indeed more difficult for people who don't have the gift."
