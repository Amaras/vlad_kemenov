**Russian**
`Parsletongue`

## Chapter 18: Back in Russia

"Ready, Neville?"

The young Longbottom grumbled, dragging his belongings in Hogsmead's station.
Only Vladmir and him had lugage.
They did not take the Hogwarts Express, but rather went through a Portkey directly to Russia.
The Gryffindor sighed when he put down his trunk, and tried to sit on his friend's.
However, he suddenly jumped back and screamed.

"Merlin Vlad, there's a snake on your trunk!"

"Don't worry, it's Sasha!" Kevin exclamied, scratching the small Ice Viper. `Hi Sssasha.`

`Hi Kevin`, the small blueish viper slithered around his wrist, and Kevin took this opportunity to pamper the snake.

"Sa... Sasha?" Neville stuttered.

"My snake", Vlad said, amused, sitting comfortable on his trunk.

"I thought only cats, owls, rats and owls ware allowed?" Hermione said, slightly surprised.
"How come we didn't see it?"

"I doubt Vlad asked for permission," Kevin smiled.
"However, this little rascal tends to roam the castle at night and sleep during the day.
She rarely goes to lectures with Vlad, and whe she does, she is always in the form of a magical bracelet."

Vlad observed Kevin talk with Sasha.
Parsletongue lessons had worked, and while Kevin's vocabulary was still limited, he could have a conversation with Sasha and other snakes.

"I thought you were Muggle-Born," Neville finally said slowly, frowning.

"Yeah, why?"

"You are a snake charmer.
It's a hereditary _Wizarding_ trait," the Gryffindor insisted.

"No, it isn't," Vlad declared.
"Everyone can learn it.
It's a language like any other.
However, it's indeed more difficult for people who don't have the gift."

"You should avoid using Parsletongue in public," Neville declared after staying silent for a minute.
"It's associated with Dark mages."

"So if I..."

Kevin fell silent and quickly lowered his sleeve on his wrist to hid the small viper.
Hermione and Neville had time to catche a glimpse of the silvery shine from a bracelet bedore Draco arrived, accompanied by his Slytherin friends.

"You are going directly to Russia?" Theodore asked with a smile, seeing the two trunks on the Hogwarts Express platform.

"I am, my aunt got premission from the English Ministry for our departure through an international Portkey from the station."

"For the better," Blaise nodded.
"My mother thinks things will be agitated at King's Cross.
Dumbledore is in probation and he's hanging on to his Headmaster title by a thread, which is not something some people like."

Vlad simply shrugged.
He did not care one bit, and Neville dicreetly smile, a smile that was nothing like the timid face he maintained, but was actually a mocking smile.
Thinking about Albus Dumbledore made him remember the face he pulled the day after Quirell died.
To find the cold corpse of a Death Eater and notice the disappearance of the Philosopher's Stone immediately threw the Professors into a panic.
Fortunately, Sergei immediately left, taking the precious gem with him to give it back to its owner.
They owed Draco a big favour.
He admitted that he found the Stone randomly.
He was leaning on an old mirror during their conversation with the Dark mage, and had looked at his reflexion, seeing himself with the Stone.
He did not really pay attention to the significance of the image, until they got back to the library.

"Your fiance is running towards you, Draco," Kevin calmly noted, sitting on Neville's trunk.
Panic briefly shone inside the Malfoy heir's grey eyes, before he calmly turned towards the girl, who was escorted by two teenagers who were built like tanks, namely Crabbe and Goyle.
The slight grimace on Draco's face evaded no one but the girl.
Pansy Parkinson, a young girl with a square face and strong features, stopped right before him, simping to him after looking at his friends with contempt.
It was true that, apart from the Slytherins, they were all wearing Muggle clothes, which was a strark contrast with the other students' wizarding outfits.

"Dray, what are you doing with Mudbloods and Bloodtraitors?
Come, I've gotten a cabin for us."

Draco softly but firmly got his arm out fo Parkinson's talons, while Hermione frowned.
The yound Muggle-born comptentuously observed the blonde act like a flirt. Eleven years old, and already acting like a prostitute, getting herself all over the young heir, Herione thought.

"Tart," she whispered, making Kevin laugh mockingly.

Neville, blushing to repress his laugh at his friend's remark, had put back his hesitant mask.
His red cheeks looked like embarassement.
Kevin, a sneer on his lips, was stroking his sleeve, under which Sasha was hissing with disgust, despite being in her bracelet form.

`Let me bite the ssscornful, Kevin.
Let me teach her mannersssss!` Sasha said, making even Vladmir sneer.
The Russian boy was observing the young couple, sitting comfortably on his trunk.
The Malfoy heir shook his head.

"Sorry Pansy," he said with a smile that was opposite his words. "I promised my friends I would be with them."

He pointed to the small Slytherin band with a cold smile, and tacitely ordered her to get back to the Hogwarts Express with her two bodyguards.
He had to tell her he would see her during the journey to get some peace, however.

"She's worse than her mother," Daphe murmured, rolling her eyes, as Parkinson walked towards the train.

"I heard quite a few rumours on Annabeth Parkinson," Vald nodded.
"If even only half of it is true, I strongly discourage this union, Draco."

"I know, I have talk talk to father about this during the holidays.
He wanted me to spend time with her before saying what I think about it."

"I doubt the marriage will ever happen," Theodore smiled softly.

A strident whistle announced the Hogwarts Express departure, and they told each other their goodbyes, Kevin even hugging his friends to hide the change of wearer of the bracelet.
Sasha disappeared into Vlad's jumper's collar as students entered the cabins.

Neville and Vladmir, alone on the platform with their heavy trunks, watched as the train started, coughing a thick cloud of smoke.

"This is it," Neville said, standing to stretch.
"We are finally on holidays!"

He got his want out, and with a sharp gesture of his wand, reduced them enough to fit into their pockets.
Unfortunately, he could not use this spell before, as it was too complex for a First year student, especially one that was thought of as a Squib.

Vlamdir laughed a bit at his friends machinations, before getting the official Portkey his aunt sent him, along with his watch.
There was one minute left before it triggered.

Neville stectched his hand to the glass, and smiled, impatient to visit his friend's country.

"We're going to arrive in the Russian Ministry for Magic; I hope it will be orderly enough," Vald said as the Portkey activated.

They felt the usual pull on their stomach and their surroundings changed, becoming a large room lit with magical torches.

**"Portkey number 187-RUR-91 from Hogsmead, arrival at 17:30.
Vladmir Vassilievitch Kemenov.
Neville Frank Longbottom."**

Vladmir and Neville quickly left the circle of runes on the ground and approached the receptionnist.
Neville observed Vladmir get his wand out and point it to the register that the man presented him.
The thick book glowed green before getting its neutral appearance afterwards.
The Gryffinder frowned, but stayed silent.

**"Welcome back in Russia, Heir-Prince Kemenov."** 

While this happened, Neville observed the two men wearing dragon leather and combat cloaks who monitored the people arriving.
Another Portkey brought a group of ten people into the rune circle and those ones were closely watched.

On a sign of his friend, Neville looked back at the clerck and got his wand out himself.
The book glowed with emerald green once again.

"Welcome to Russia, Earl Longbottom.
I hope your stay here will be enjoyable," the Russian man said with a thick Slavic accent.

"What was that?" Neville asked once they go out of the room.

"Routine checks.
To come to Russia by Portkey or Apparition, you need to arrive in one of the Ministry's locations.
They check our identity through our magical fingerprints to check we are indeed the wizards they are expecting.
The circle of runes would have revealed a stowaway and the Aurors would have aprehended them."

"Well, Russians aren't kidding with security.
In England, anybody can create Portkeys as long as they are powerful enough, and there is definitely no control on international arrivals."

Vladmir smiled discreetly and said that it was different in Russia.
Every magical transportation way was monitored...
Except if you called on the Miracle Court.
However, Vladmir did not say this phrase in the middle of the Russian Ministry.
He valued his life a bit too much for that...

It was thus with a young English Pure-Blood in tow that Vladmir traversed the Russian Ministry's St-Petersburg location.
He noticed the differences with the previous year, looking for the results of the collapse of the Muggle USSR.
Apparently, nothing important changed with day-to-day operations.
He still noticed the official decrees creating 15 Ministries associated with the new republics.
His attention was focused on the independance decree of Ukraine, and wondered the impact it would have on the Mirazh.
The Ukrainian branch of the Miracle Court had its territory on several other new republics...
Vladmir stopped thinking about political things and focused back on his friend.

After they walked through numerous corridors and halls, the two boys finally got out of the Ministry, and Neville was surprised to see they got out of a huge palace bordering a river.
He looked back and, stunned, observed the bright yellow frontage on which two things shocked him.
A large plaque was stamped with the official symbol of the Russian Ministry and cyrillic letters, and a flag was fluttering, looking like the ex-USSR one.
Except on the red background the hammer was replaced with a wand, and the sickle with a curved sword.

"It's a chachka," Vladmir declared, following his friend's gaze.
"A traditional Circassian sabre, which has long been part of the Muggle military uniform."

"The aurors had some, didn't they?"

"Indeed," Vlad smiled.
"However, their blades are different: they are forged by goblins and reinforced with spells.
Their chachkas can stop a hex and slice virtually everything."

"And what's written there?"

"Russian Ministry for Magic, federal district of Saint-Petersburg."

"Federal district?"

"That's the way the Russian state is organised," Vlad anwsered with a contrite smile, "it's a bit complicated to explain it to you right now.
In any case, welcome to Russia!"

Neville then really looked around him, and opened his eyes wide when he saw the beauty of the city.
The quays around the Neva were full of people, and he suddenly understood why Vladmir had insisted that they wore Muggle clothes when he saw the tourist crowds around historical monuments.

"Is that... the Winter Palace?" the yound Gryffindor asked, pointing at the huge palace on the other side of the river.
"The Ministry for Magic is right in front of one of the biggest Muggle museums in the world?"

"'Hidden in plain sight the wizard is, because what is obvious is overlooked'," Vladmir said with a smile, citing an old Russian wizarding proverb.
"In Russia, we feel that we don't have to be hidden.
Officially, the Saint-Petersburg Ministry is a famous hospital, and the Moscow Ministry's entryway is right in front of the Kremlin on the Red Square.
It looks like an Opera.
Muggles can enter it, but they will only see a typical concert hall."

Vlad observed the surprised look on his friend's face, and wholeheartedly laughed when he embraced him and saluted him the traditional way.

"**Welcome to Russia, comrade!**"

Neville really blushed when he felt the sudden contact with Vlad, and let himself be pulled towards a pedestrian crossing to get to the other side of the avenue full of cars.

"Do you know any Russian history?" Vladmir asked him playfully when he saw a tall man with a well-groomed beard nodding at him from the railing over the quays, his eyes hidden behind sunglasses.
Besides him, a tall man with bushy hair and string features was talking with him, contemplating the Winter Palace.

"The previous centuries, broadly, but basically nothing from the last fifty years..."

The young Longbottom then saw the two strangers, noticing the strong stature and the paleness, as well as the rigid bearing of the first; and the dark aura from the second one.
His doubts became certainties when he saw the first one lift his glasses to smile at them, showing two dark red eyes.
The two men walked towards them, the crowd instinctively splitting to let them through.

"Neville, let me introduce you to my great-great uncle, Nikolai Aleksnadrovitch Romanov, also known as Nikolai II of Russia; as well as his closest friend, the Dark Mage Grigori Yefimovitch Rasputin.
Uuncle, Grigori, this is Neville Frank Longbottom."

"Pleased to meet you boy," the Dark Mage declared with a charming voice.
"We have heard a lot about you from Vlad."

"I would like to say the same," Neville managed to say while giving his friend an unkind look, "but Vlad likes to keep a lot of secrets."

The vampired chuckled and nodded.

"We know, Neville.
Vlad is quiet as a grave when it comes to certain topics."

"Do you understand Russian?" Grigori Rasputin suddenly asked, observing the Longbottom Heir closely.

"No sir," he replied, slightly tense.
this man was a Dark Mage was of a very different temperament than the ones living in england.

"I am a Dark Mage, Neville.
However, I don't torture people, and I am not looking to conquer my country."

The young Longbottom blushed slightly, before nodding his head and mentally apologising, making the Dark Mage smile.
Bloody Legilimens...

"I can teach you Occlumency, kid," Rasputin laughed.
"You already have strong bases, and I think that in a few weeks, you could become excellent at it.

And thus began Neville's and Vlad's holidays.
The young English noble discovered the Kemenov palace, and the Russian wizarding traditions.
A routine quickly developed, with the two boys' day split into three periods.

Every morning, they worked.
Vlad had Transfiguration classes with a severe but pedagogical vampire, as well as Occlumency classes, in which Nevill also took part.
The young Gryffindor thus discovered a Dark Mage very different from English stereotypes: patient, careful, and most of all very knowledgeable on his subject.
Grigori Rasputin was the best teacher on Mind Arts, and Neville's progress was meteoric, while Vlad was strenghening his mental barriers.

After they studied, they relaxed.
They spent the start of the afternoon sightseeing and relaxing.
Neville discovered his best friend's country, as Vlad had done during the winter solstice holidays.
The young Russian took his through the twists and turns of the wizarding streets of Saint-Petersburg, then Moscow's , and Neville never ceased to be surprised by colourful, friendly and lively places.
The largest wizarding square in Saint-Petersberd was along one of the tributaries of the Neva.
It rivaled London's Trafalgard Square in size.
Vladmir also pointe him to the entryway of the Russian Ministry, where the same flag proudly floated, as well as Gringott's bank.
However, nothing prepared him to discover a huge wizarding hall in the middle of the city, gathering herborists, apothicaries, artisans...

The magical population was impressive for the young English noble.
Many wizards and witches walking in the streers, as well as many magical creatures.

Diagon Alley, as well as London side alleys where only humans walked, would seem very out of place here.
The young Longbottom discoverd that Russia was a place heterogeneous and proud to be.
When English wizards were secretive and racists, Russians were more open-minded and welcoming.
Dozens of races freely rubbed shoulders in the wizarding spots.
Neville saw numerous vampires and goblins, as well as rarer species that few English wizards could brag about seeing in a bar.
Dwarves, usually living deep in their mines were walking in and out of Gringott's to barter.
Veelas openly walked out in the streets, their face uncovered and their magic on low power.
He even saw a dark elf, even if they were thought never to leave their forests, and a young korrigan, a distant cousins of the goblins.
Neville then understood the solid knowledge of his friends on other magical creatures and realised how much the English society was retrograde and poor.

The third and final moment of their day was the most fastidious and the longest for Neville.
As a guest, he could not participate, only observe and listen.
Even then, he thought he was fortunate enough to be able to assist Vladmir, only the tatoo on his arm and an Unbreakable Oath had allowed him to be tolerated at the meetings.
Indeed, the last part of the day was about the internal affairs of Clan Kemenov.

Not the family, the Clan.
The corporation which brought together several wizarding families and a vampire clan, under the direction of Katya as the Kemenov matriarch.
Clan Kemenov had an important weight in Occidental Russian politics and enonomy, and Vladmir, as heir to the noble and ancient Kemenov family, had many duties.
Neville also suspected that his obligations were linked to the Mirage Court, but he was not initiated in the Eastern Europe branch, and considered himself lucky to know the truth.
Thus, he attentively listened to the problems, talking with Vladmir about the events outside of meetings.
He was starting to get his hopes up about a rehabilitation of the Underground, the English branch of the Mirage Court.

The two holiday weeks were very instructive for Neville, and he left with a smile on his face.
He was organising a surprise for Vladmir's birthday, with Katay's and Sergei's help.
On July 31, the Russian's birthday, their whole friends group came together to the Lognbottom's before their departure to Estonia.
Vladmir was taking part in the Summer flightracing event, and they would encourage him.

Agusta Longbottom, happy to the joy on her grandson's face, had been very helpful.
The old lady, despite some sharp remarks of her own, went to fetch Hermione and Kevin at their home, while Draco got there by Floo powder.
Lucius Malfoy had flinched when he heard about the young Gryffindor's invitation, before his son, like the good Slytherin he was, pointed out Clan Kemenov's implication in the race.

The four friends, chaperonned by Lady Longbottom, had taken a Portkey to Estonia.
Nikolai was waiting for them and smiled when they appeated, and Neville, recognising the former Tsar, set off through a relatively dense crowd to get the the vampire.

His friends and grandmother followed him while thousands of wizards and witches ammassed themselves along huge cliffs.
Children played on mini-brooms, duly supervised by their parents.
Acrobats were showing off marvellous magic tricks.
Groups of wizards were talking, some wearing colourful and weird outfits.
Everywhere, there were yells, and laughs, and joy all around.

"Blimey!" Draco whispered, "it's as lively as a Quidditch World Cup!"

"Races are very popular," Nikolai declared, guiding the small group to the granstand.
"There is still an hour left bedore it starts, however I think we should go the the stands now to get the best possible spots."

"The stands?" Kevin asked, looking all around him to find them.

Mrs. Longbottom smiled and pointed to the sky.
They all looked up before gasping in delight.
A hundred metres above them, three gigantic grandstands were floating in the sky, like veritable fortresses.
Made out of a dark wood, they were brightened up with around twenty different emblems; they towered over the scenary.

"Are those the racers' banners?"

"Indeed", the vampire smiled and the group queued up for one of the flying carpets shuttling back and forth to the magical stands, under the captivated look of the two Muggle-borns.

"Vlad's is the third one, isn't it? The one with gold, silver, carmine and black?"

Nikolai looked at the small human girl with a renewed respect.
Sergei was right, Hermione had a great potential.
He observed the banners and smiled once again when he saw the red deer with silver antlers on a golden field with nine stars.
A British Pure-Blood House...

"I think you know another one."

They all took some time to observe the other banners, and Draco nearly choked as Neville laughed.

"*Weasley?* Weasleys are in the race?"

"Only one of them... Charlie is a very good flightracer.
I have never seen his family in assistance, so I don't think they know."

"Charlie Weasley was Gryffindor's Seeker while at Hogwarts," Augusta Longbottom pensively said.

"It's the position that's the closest to race conditions," Nikolai agreed.

"I have not seen the Earl Weasley coat-of-arms in decades," the old lady continued with an emotional smile.
"They look as great as ever."

"They are _earls_?" Malfoy choked again.

"You did not listen to your teacher, *heretem* Malfoy," Lady Longbottom said curtly.
"The Weasley House may be poor, but their line traces back as far as your, and from what I can remember, they are linked to the Malfoy House three generations back."

"Are all Pure-Blood Houses noble?" Hermione asked.

"No," Kevin said, remembering a similar in the dungeons corridor at the start of the year.
"However, virtually all of the most ancient ones are noble.
If I remember correctly, Longbottoms are dukes and their heir is an Earl, the same thing applies for the Malfoys.
Weasleys are earls, while their heir is a baron."

"What about the Potters?"

"Their House is one of the most ancient and msot prestigious ones.
Only five Houses can trace their ancestries back to the time of Merlin himself.
Those are the Bones, Prince, Nott, and Rowle Houses.
They are all prince."

"Prince?
This title is reserved to the Royal Family, isn't it?" Hermione asked.

"It isn't.
It also applies to the descendants of the four knight-wizards of the Round Table."

"There were wizards?"

"Knight-wizards," Mrs. Longbottom declared.
"It was a military order that was dissolved in the 12th century.
Out of the hundreds of members, you know the names of three of them: Mordred, Galahad, and Tristan."

"Tristan?" Draco pointed out, frowning.

"The hero from the Muggle tale *Tristan and Iseult*".

"What about the fifth House?" Kevin asked as they embarked upon the flying carpet.

"They descend from Artus, also known as Arthur Pendragon."

"Which House...?"

"That is a secret only known to the Five Families.
I think it is lost to time," Augusta Longbottom answered with a smile.

She gracefully stepped off the carpet, helped by Nikolai who had curteously offered her his arm, and they discoverd a beautiful, wild scenary.
A long and steep cliff towered above the sea, waves crashing powerfully on the rocks.
Far away, a river sprung from a dense forest, winding in mighty rapids before forming a great waterfall directly into the Baltic Sea.

"What's the route?" Hermione asked, looking for delimitations.

"It's part of the point.
Nobody knows the path, not even the competitors.
Arrows appear to point the right way when they get close enough.
If a racers misses one of them, they lose time, and thus spots in the ranking.
Furthermore, the arrows only appear during the first lap.
Once the route is defined, the contestants may take shortcuts, although they must pass through checkpoints, which are signaled during the first lap."

"It's..."

"Technical and quick," Kevin marvelled.

"... and dangerous," a known voice added.

"Lady Kemenov," Agusta smiled and stood up to greet the young Lady.
"It is a pleasure to see you again.
How is your nephew?"

"He is well and focused.
It is his second event this summer, and he hopes to finish in the top 10."

"And how are the bets?" the old Lady asked teasingly.

"Going well," Katya smiled back, as she had just checked on the Mirage Court bookmakers, who were currently closing the bets.
"The race is starting soon, you should probably get seated.
Here..."

Katya gave them several pairs of Omniculars and explained how they worked to the two Muggle-borns.

"There!" Hermione suddenly yelled, "Vlad is here!"

Indeed, the twenty races had just appeared, sitting on broomsticks that were sightly different from the ones used in Quidditch, with simpler and more aerodynamic lines.

"Wow," Draco whispered, looking carefully at the brooms, "race Steas and Comets!"

"How are they different from the usual Nimbus and Comets?" Kevin asked with a frown.

"They are the world's fastests brooms!
The finest in brooms," the Malefoy heir raved.
"They are hyper-reactive and hyper-sensitive!
In Quidditch, only Seekers use them, if at all."

"Why, if they are so good?"

"It's because they are only stable while flying ahead, not in a stationary position.
Any other player plays upright, and the slightest movement can make a Stea swerve."

"So Beaters and Chasers definitely should not play with those..." Hermione said, thinking about the jerky motions when they hit a Bludger.

"Indeed..."

They all looked at the grandstands, which were not at capacity, and at the participants while the host was starting to announce the racers.
They all were wearing thick protecting gear, which somehow left their head and joints free to move.
They also were equipped with a helmet and goggles.
Furthermore, they all had their wands strapped to their wrist.

Vladmir seemed like he was the youngest flightracer, and was hovering besides a tall, well-built ginger guy who the students recognised as Charlie.

"The next one, you all know him!
Please make some noise for Charlie Weasley!
Undisputed Romanian champion, and three-time winner of the Summer Race!"
