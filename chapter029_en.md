## Chapter 29: The Saturnalia Ball

On the day of the holidays, Vladmir was standing with Katya, Lucius, Augusta and Sergei on platform 9 3/4 at King's Cross station.
The true holidays were finally starting!
Not that he did not appreciate his first week, although his responsibilites for both the Russian Mirage Court and the Kemenov Clan could be quite tiring.

The young heir was trying to ignore the questionning looks the parents gave him.
The presence of a Hogwarts-age child on the platform was rare, but given that he talked with the vampire in Russian, they probably thought that they were close relations of the Malfoy patriarch.
*"I have never been this happy that Katya sued the authors who used by mane for their so-called biorgraphies,"* Vlad sighed, observing the crowd of parents around them, increasingly denser as time ticked on.
Even if he did not like crowds, he was amused by the lost looks on the rare Muggles' faces.

*"The Prophet did not publish photographs without her permission,"* Sergei Nodded.
*"So they don't recognise you as their Saviour...
Don't they look like one of those Slytherins... Greengrass?"*

Vladmir followed the vampire's gaze, and saw a thin and austere woman, with three children in tow.
Many familes looked at her extremeny warily, but they were not the only ones subject to unamicable attention.
Severas other families Vladmir kne were Pure-Bloods were stared at.
Strangely, he recognised a good number of Lucius's former colleagues, all Death Eaters that were exonerated by the Imperium use excuse...
Quite the good joke...
All Pure-Bloods were trained since childhood to resist this spell, to make sure they never fell into forced alliances--political or matrimonial--or even givin assets to an interested person.
Children that could not resist were given powerful protection amulets, very efficient and incredibly expensive.

*"The children do look like Daphne,"* Vlad eventually answered.
"Lucius, I thought that the English Pure-Bloods only had one heir, as a rule?"

Lucius Malfoy, in a conversation with Katya, turned his head to the young Russian, then followed his gaze.
He squinted as he recognised the man who was approaching his wife.
As if by a sixth sense, the unknown man seemed to feel their looks and slightly turned to have them in his field of vision.

"They have, although some families nearly disappeared; his wife is the last heir of an old and noble family.
To avoid its extinction, they second son will inherit it.
They had two daughters before having their two heirs, Daphne and Astoria...
I think the youngest is called Dorian Helwynn, not Greengrass."

Vladmir nodded, still looking at Daphne's father who was approaching them.

"Lord Malfoy, Lady Longbottom, it is a pleasure to see you again.
Ladies, gentlement, I am Dwayne Greengrass."

"Dwayne," Lucius briefly greeted him," Let me introduce you to Lady Kemenov and his heir, as well as the Saint-Petersbrug Knyaz."

Augusta simply nodded and sniffled, amused, as the Greengrass pratriach's eyes were fixated on the vampire's red eyes.
He was obviously feeling uneasy, and Vladmir vaguely smiled as he slightly bowed.

"Mister Greengrass..."

From Lucius's presentations, not only did Daphne's father not have a title--he did not use any title in the usual presentation-- but he was not in the Malfoy family's good books.
One only had to hear Lucius use only his first name with such familiarity, and his cold greeting, even for an aristocrat...

While the adults exchanged usual trivialities, Vladmir thought that he should brief Hermione and Kevin on etiquette and the rules of presentation before the start of the Saturnalia Ball.
First impressions were key in the aristocracy, and he hoped that they would not involuntarily pour the whole English Pure-Blood community's scorn on the Malfoy patriarch.

Lucius Malfoy had taken a great risk when he invited Hermione and Kevin, two Muggle-Borns.
He had to be perfect on every point, from bearing and appearance, to conversation etiquette and political knowledfe.
For the first and last issues, Vlad was not worried.
In the last two years, his two friends had taken on the manners of the magical aristocracy, first unwillingly, then consciously.
Their knowledge ware incredible, and last year's Christmas present had something to do with it.
The twelve tomes of the Wizarding Education quickly passed from Kevin's hands to Hermione's, and they had quickly learned the basic subtelties.
Now, they had to learn the rules of rhetoric and apply them.

A long whistle rang out in the station, bringing back Vladmir to the then and now.
The already excited people started to move.

The Hogwarts Express was arriving in the station.

Vladmir sighed as he was jostled, but he reassured the small ten-year-old with a smile when he apologised.
Realising that his aunt's technique was better than his, he walked away from the tracks to avoid being stepped on.
He understood why the previous year, their parents were waiting for them, leaning on the wall.
It was the calmer spot.

He leaned against the bricks, putting his hands in his pockets, looking at the red locomotive release smoke plumes.
They were quite the array, he thought, looking at the rest of the adults.
Katya and Augusta had even summonned large and comfortable armchairs, while Lucius was sitting on Katya's armrest.
Sergei was in the same position as himself, leaning against the wall, but appeared more menacing, as was expected of a bodyguard.

The train slowly slowed down and stopped, metal screeching against metal, and the whistle rang out again.
The compartment doors instantly opened, and there was chaos.
Hundreds of students jumped from the wagons, and a blond head envetually came out from the front cars, accompanied by Theodore Jr., Blaise and Daphne.

"Lady Longbottom, Lady Kemenov, Father, Vlad..."

Draco was keeping his composure, using protocol greetings, but Vlad could see that his Slytherin friend was dying to openly laugh at the absurdity of seeing three nobles sttting down on the station platform as if they were in a drawing room.
From the sparkles in the other three snakes' eyes, it was a feeling that they shared.

"Grand... mother..."

Neville, in turn, could not refrain from laughing.
He laughed out out when he arrived behind the four Slytherins, while Augusta was slowly standing up, dusting her velvet robes, as Katya and Lucius greeted the four Slytherins.

"Ow! Ow!"

Neville's laughed stopped as soon as the venerable Longbottom matriarch caught her grandson's ear and sharply twisted it.
Her harsh face, underneath her infamous stuffed hat, were meanacing, as she threatened her grandson with the worst torment to have dared mock her.

"Give some respect to your elders, kid," Sergei smiled, brigging himself Lucius's and Katya's dark glares at the 'elder' denomination.

Vlad turned away from the amusing and completely overacted spectacle of the Longbottom family--they had to keep appearances of the poor Neville molested by her authoritarian grandmother--before smiling when he saw his other friends get down from the train.
They had travelled seperately to spend some time with their other friends.
Hermione was smiling, coming out with the Weasley and Patil twins, while Kevin was climbing down the stairs with Luna and two other Ravenclaws of their year.

Vladmir's heart ached when he saw his best friend.
He semmed tired, dark rings under his eyes, even if he had a lively conversation with Lisa Turpin.
He noted his weary look at the other students who had walked away from his path.
Unsurprisingly, the Kemenov heir saw this wariness spontaneously spread to the parents.
Men were wolves in some situations...

Augusta Longbottom was the one to stop all this detrimental attention on the Muggle-Born.
She abandonned Neville after she had finished reprimanding him, and the old woman approached Kevin and put a hand on his shoulder.
Vldmir realised that Kevin was completely exhausted when he saw his friend jump.
Never had Kevin been taken by surprise after they had started to work together on the manners a respectable Pure-Blood had to maintain.
Kevin had a gift to feel other around him, and few things escaped his attention.
the young Ravenclaw quickly regained his composure and politely greeted Lady Longbottom.

"You friend does not seem well," Lucius softly noted.

"He had hidden it well when I saw him yesterday," Vlad whispered.
He had gone to bring one last ingrediant for Snape's Veritaserum, and Kevin had been as usual, smiling with a false innocence and working hard to finish their Galleons .
He had gone back to Hogwarts only once, and that was fortunate, because Hermione had harrassed him on Goblin habits.
She had found the Hobgoblin's behaviour weird, and Vlad did not want to tell her in Hogwarts...
He hoped the she had forgotten about it, because repercussions would be enormous.

"He did not want to worry you," Draco sighed.
"He knows you have many responsibilites, but Huuflepuffs and Gryffindors were particularly vicious with him."

"Weasley the sixth?" Vladmir growled.

The last boy of the family was not that mean, and he remembered his talent in chess, which, if exploited correctly, could be remarkably efficient.
He was, however, quite narro-minded, which was disappointing and hurtful for his friends.
It was strange, considering that his elders, members of different Mirage Courts, and the first one even worked with Goblins.
He should have been more open...

"No, strangely the weasle has stayed put...
I think Hermione and Neville had a say with their year's Housemates.
However, the other ones were nasty!"

Augusta came back with Kevin, hand still on his shoulder, and Lucius approached him to press the young Muggle-Born's free arm, leaning towards him to whisper a few words to him.
All students looked at them from the corner of their eyes, and many immediately looked away.
They were the students born and raised in the magical words.

Some gestures mattered a lot, and Kevin Entwhistle was undeniably protected by the Longbottom and Malfoy families, in addition to the Kemenovs.
He was better left alone...

Rapidly, feeling the need for the youngsters to get away from the crowded platform, the four adults each took a student and Disapparated.
They had agreed on their destination before the arrival of the Hogwarts express, beause they wished to discuss the programme of the Christmas holidays in peace.
They thus arrived in a small empty room that was made warm by the decorations on the wall and the soft lighting.
They were undeniably in the magical world, seeing that the portraits were alive and in soft conversation.
Hermione looked around with surprise, quickly followed by Kevin, who, despite his exhaustion, stayed deeply curious.

"Were are we?"

"In the arrival room of Café Merlin," Katya said, opening the door, which pivoted silently, while a small bell rang.
A soft whisper passed through the door, as Neville told them that it was a bar in Bolduc alley, in the magical London.

The bar was chic and enjoyable, in the purest English tradition.
The panelling was perfectly waxed, and the spacious tables were occupied by many people, while a long counter ran along a whole wall.
A waiter arrived as soon as they left the room, wearing an impeccable French waiter livery.

"Ladies, Gentlemen, welcome to Café Merlin!
How may I help you?"

"Would you happen to still have a table for eight available?" Lucius politely asked.

"Certainly Milord.
Would you prefer inside or on the terrace?"

The two Muggle-Borns raised their eyebrows, but they stayed silent.
Terrace? While there was snow outside and the temperature was near 0°C?

"Maybe terrace?" Augusta asked the group.

"I think it is an excellent idea," Katya said with a smile.

They followed the waiter, who galantly opened the door in front of the ladies.
Hermione quickly followed Augusta and Katya, before Vlad, Neville and Kevin followed suite, then allowing the two men to move.
Café Merlin was a place reserved to the magical aristocracy and bourgeoisie, etiquette had to be followed.

The terrance was revealed to them, on a small square covered in undisturbed snow.
This time, Neville answerd Kevin's question by explaining that wizards and witches Apaprated from shop to shop to avoid walking in snow, hence the place was immaculate.

The waiter swiftly sat the ladies down, then took their orders, letting them admire the magical square.
Snow as still fallling, but seemed to disappear a few centimetres above them, leaving them dry and strangely warm.

"It's a heat bubble," Vlad smiled at Hermione's fascination.
"It is as if we were inside the café."

"How are you Kevin?" Katya asked softly.

The Ravenclaw raised his head, and grimaced gloomily.

"I am tired Madam, and quite upset at my schollmates behaviour."

Agusta Longbottom passed a hand in the young boy's hair and warmly smiled at him, her wrinkled face becoming radiant.

"Youngster, if you have any problem in Hogwars, tell your friends, and you still hesitate, please send me an owl.
I may be old, but I am still quite the powerful witch, when I want to."

"I concur on this," Lucius mumbled, "I spent three days in the Hospital Wing after Longbottom Senior cried in her mother's skirts."

Neville's curious look was visible to all as Augusta flippanlty pointed her wand at Lucius, who jumped, a painful rictus on his lips.

"That is not pleasant Augusta," he groused, rubbin his arm at the spot where the Longbottom matriarch's wand touched him."

"Sergei talked about respecting your elders, I believe you should remember it young man," the old woman sententiously declared in response.

A strange shine passed on Kevin's gaze, as he looked at Neville's grandmother, then he softly laughed.

"I really feel like I have one big family," he whispered.
"Thank you all."

All his friends stared at him, but the waiter arrived with their order floating behind him.
The hot beverages landed in front of them, along with biscuits and fresh fruits.
Hermione was the one to ask the question they all were thinking about.

"I thought you had one big family?" she whispered.

Kevin tensed up, but kept a neutral face that pained all the adults around the tables.
Aristocratic manners were necessary, but it always pained them to see that they sometimes backfired.
Kevin put down his cup of hot cocoa and stared at the appetizing that floated on top.

"I have..."

A nearly inaudible answer, whose reason was obvious for Vladmir and his aunt.
Kevin was part of the 20%, those 20% percent of Muggle-Born magical children who, after the first apparitions of magical power happened, were either abused, or isolated from their familiy.
Vlad was sure that he would have been part of those 20% if Katya had not forcefully taken him from his maternal aunt.
How now understood why he had never seen Kevin's family on the platform.

"Your family is..."

"Afraid of my powers," Kevin admitted, lowering his eyes.
"I love them, but I am somewhat transparent to them."

"Do they neglect you," Lucius dully asked.

Child abuse, physical of psychological was something Lucius Malfoy abhorred.
Magical children were sacred in his world.
They were not many, and even if the most traditional Pure-Blood famlies had a strict education that did not leave room for emotions, children were always treated well, and kne they were loved and desired.

"No!" Kevin exclaimed, opening his eyes wide, as if he was surprised that the Lord could imagine this.
"No, they don't, it's just...
My siblings don't really talk to me any more, and my parents avoid me a bit when I come back home."

"You are not alone in this," Augusta contemptuously said.
"The Manistry never did anything to protect the young wizards and witches, even if some should have been taken from their families to grow up serenely."

"You can come at my place for the summer holidays," Hermione offered suddenly.
"My parents are terrific and they accept magic.
This way, you would not be too disorientated!"

"I... Can I come this winter too?" Kevin asked weakly.

"I regret to inform you that no, Kevin, you will not be able to go to Hermione's house," Lucius intervened, an amused smile on his lisps despite the sudden sadness in the young man's gaze.
"Let me remind you that Draco invited you for the hole holidays, and that you have a ball the day after tomorrow."

"Nooo!"

Kevin, all his pain disappeared, let his head fall on the table, whining.

"We really need to make sure those dance lessons are useful," Draco sneered.

"Cruel world, snake in the grass," the Muggle-Born lamented.
"I hate dancing!"

"Oi!
I'm not that bad of a partner!" Hermione protested, as she had learned to dance the traditional ballroom dances, from the classics identical to the Muggles like Waltz and Tango, to wizarding classics like the wizarding jig.

"I don't like to dance," the Ravenclaw repeared, making the adults laugh as Hermione started to giggle.
It was heartwarming to see the young boy get his good humour back.

"Balls have an great impact on the aristocratic world, and a ball needs dancing."

"Why are balls this important?" Hermione asked.
"I thought there were meant for important celebrations."

"Indeed, however there are more importantly social and political events," Katya explained, finishing her cup.
"Balls allow families to officially present their heirs, identify matrimonial alliances, discuss politics outside the Ministry...
Many business deals are negociated and concluded during those events..."

"I read something about the presentation of children, but I did not understand everything."

"There was a reason for your danse lessons," Draco declared, "I have never been in a ball before."

"Neither have I," Vlad said.
"Tradition dictated that children must be presented when they are twelve years old.
We all turned this age this year, and it is the Malfoy's ball."

"To be presented at my family's ball have two positive impacts.
First grat prestige because we are quite the influent families, and second the alliance games.
Rumours are starting to spread that our three families are linked, and what happened at the station was the perfect example.
It will be an official confirmation, and you will be the only children to be presented this time."

"Pansy was hysterical, she thought she would be presented during the holidays, despite our engagement being broken," Draco laughed.
"Either her parents need to organise a ball themselves, but it will be pretty lonely due to their rank, or they need to negociate an invitation in another ball."

"It's... complex," Hermione noted.

"We suspected it already," Kevin mumbled, still slumped on the table, but listening.
Indded, his curiosity was paramount in any circumstance.
He eventually straightened up with a satisfied look.

"I will not be able to come, I have no formal robes!"

The knowing faces of the four adults alarmed the Ravenclaw, squinting his eyes in worry.

"You anticipated this problem."

It was an observation, not a question, and he slumped back on the table.

"Of course!" Augusta joyfully said.
"We hestitated for a long time on Hermione's robes, but I am sure she will be splendid in it.
As for your, I trust the Malfoy genes.
Lucius's line has been famous for their good taste and their elegance.
This has become a real tradition for them!"

Draco and Lucius puffed themselves up with an identical face, proud of their reputation.

"They just are compulsive buyers," Neville whispered in Kevin's ear.
"Leave them in a clothing shop, and they buy all its stock.

Kevin laughed out loud, bringing smiles on every face.
It was one of the the Ravenclaw's quality, he always kept his spirits up.

"Very well, I think we need to leave, we are awaited," Lucius declared a few minutes after an appeasing silence had fallen on them and they had admired more and more snow flakes falling above them.
He made a small motion of his wand, and the waiter immediately arrived.

The Café Merlin wizard presented a small, delicately calligraphed card to the Lord, on which he pointed his wand.
The small seal on the end of the note glowed and the wax melted, on which Lucius affixed his signet ring, imprinting the Malfoy coat-of-arms.
It was the equivalent of the Muggle check, with his family seal containing his magic serving as undeniable proof.

They slowly stood up, and Augusta Disapparated with Kevin to greet his parents and explain that, as they had written to them, he was invited for the duration of the holidays.
Meanwhile, Lucius brought them to the gate of his manor.
Snow had stopped falling here, but everything was coated with snow, appart from the impressive path.

"The Mistress is here, Master," a House Elf annouced, appearing with a small pop.

"Tell her we have guests, and that her presence is demanded," Lucius growled.

"Father..."

Draco's hesitation worried Lucius.
He knew perfectly well that his son was wondering about Narcissa's implication in the current troubles of the school.
They all were convinced that Ginerva Weasley's small diary was the artefact she introduced in the castle.
It only added to the wrongdoings that could be attributed to her, with serving the Sark Lord behind her husband's back, and betraying the Blacks and the English Mirage Court.
However, in order to avoid alerting Narcissa, Lucius had not confronted his wife.
Gathering evidence beforehand, then striking stringly was more the usual methods of the Malfoy patriarch.

Lucius looked at his visitors, and noticed that the three Russians, Hermione and Neville had quitely walked some distance away to leave them some privacy, admiring the white scenery and the abode they saw behind the gate.

"Narcissa is still your mother Draco," Lucius softly said, kneeling to get the his heir's height.
"For now, she suspects nothing, so stay as you are, the little haughty and capricious boy she knows."

"I am not sure I can behave as usual father.
I... I changed with Vladmir and the other and..."

"I am not asking you to lie about who you are.
You are growing, maturing, it's perferctly normal at your age.
I just don't want you to show your mother you have doubts about her."

Draco nodded and looked at the manor.

"Good."

Lucius kissed his son on his forehead, smiling at his surprise, and stood up.
He rarely showed his affection this way, but he felt the need to show his love to his son.
He dusted his robes as Augusta came back with her protégé.
Apparently, from Kevin's relieved face, the visit went well.

"Narcissa is in the manor," Lucius told everyone.

"She was absent for months, he she comes back now?" Sergei wondered, getting a slap on the head from Katya with a warning look.

"She has a son, and surely wants to see him, idiot," the Kemenov matriarch snarled.
"It's about time you learned human emotions again!"

Serge looked daggers at the young woman, while Vladmir sneered under his cape.

"You look like an old couple," Augusta noted with an amused smile.

The children laughed as they saw Katya blush, saying she never had 'this kind of thought for this old decrepit vampire', in her own words, while Vladmir, who knew her aunt perfectly well and her emotions for the vampire, raising an eyebrow in surprised when he noted some of the reactions.
Katya was the second generation of Kemenov that Sergei had seen grow up.
He was more of a confidant big brother than a lover...

It was in a good mood that they walked the path to the manumental entryway of the ancestral Malfoy manor.
A thin blonde woman was standing outside the door, her bearing stiff and aristocratic as the calmly walked the last meters before the manor forecourt.

"Mother," Draco smiled, walking towards Narcissa Malfoy, née Black.
A sincere smile stretched on her lips and she briefly hugged her son, whispering something in his ear.

Lucius was right.
Narcissa was Draco's mother, and she loved him.
Whatever she had done, they could not reproach her for this.

"Welcome to Malfoy manor.
Lady Longbottom, Lady Kemenov, Knyaz Pokhastovine, it is a pleasure to meet you once more."

Although pleasure was somewhat exagerated, seeing the look she gave the Longbottoms.
After all, they were officially a Light family, and she was not really part of the Underground, and thus did not know they were a Master family...

Sergeigot closer to galantly kiss the woman's hand, making her blush.
The vampire perfectly rememberd her discomfort and fear when they first met.
He reveled in managing to scare her again, finding it delectable.

"Draco, don't you introduce me to your friends?" Narissa smiled.

"Yes mother, let me introduce you to Hermione Granger, Kevin Entwhistle, Neville Longbottom, and Vladmir Kemenov."

The two Muggle-Borns applied their good knowledge of wizarding etiquette when they gave her perfect greetings for the occasion, in this case a slight bow and a brief visual contact before lowering their eyes in a sign of respect.

"Granger and Entwhistle...
I do not know these names," Narcissa softly observed, as she was avoiding to look at the young Kemenov heir.
She remembered seeing him in a Russian library, and she hoped he did not...
As she avoided her gaze, she did not his how interested he was with the ring on her middle finger, a small but remarkable ring, as a black onyx was set in it.
Onyx was a masculine stone, rarely worn by women, which made it quite strange on her finger.
However, she noticed her son tensing up and her husband warning her with his eyes.

"I am Muggle-Born, Madame," Kevin calmly responded.

Narcissa Malfoy slightly stared and looked daggers at her son.
He had hidden their blood status in his letters.
She simply pinched her lips and invited them in.

<hr>

The end of the day came quickly.
They were brought to their appartments in the guest wing, and they got together of the dinner, quite friendly despite Narcissa's silence.
She abandonned them as soon as the meal was done under the pretense that numerous things were left to organise for the ball of the nect day, and Lucius smiled sadly when one of the House Elves followed her to monitor her comings and goings.

"Not that my wife is gone, I think it is time to bring up some things," the host declared, having cast provacy charms and asked a House Elf to tell him if her wife happened to come back.

The children raised their heads from their cups of hot cocoa, sitting in front of the chimney of the grand drawing room.
The four adults looked at them attentively and they looked at each other as the children stood up.

"What things father?" Draco asked with curiosity.

"My real allegiance son, and in some way, your future."

Katya settled down on the carpet in front of Kevin, and smiled softly when Neville and Draco sniggered upon seeing their venerable parents settle down as well.
Augusta Longbottom and Lucius Malfoy sitting on the ground in front of a chimney?
It was so unlikely, and yet!

"What did you want to talk about?" Hermione asked

"You all know what suspicions we have on Narcissa...
What do you know of the English Mirage Court?"

"It disappeared years ago," Kevin declared.
"Neville only wears the mark because he comes from a Master family."

"Very Well, I don't think you know the other Master branches..."

"I don't," Neville responded, surprised, only the Triads know.
Their members have a specific mark on their official coats, but since they safeguard anonimity..."

"Blacks were a Master line."

"Black... Like Narcissa Black?" Augusta asked, frowining.
"And how to you know that, Lucius?"

Lord Malfoy smiled and pulled up his right sleeve.
Above the Dark Mark, the Underground's symbol glowed, the crown of the Triads and their heirs over it.

"You are..."

"I am the last member of the former Triad.
The other two were Julius O'Summers and Orion Black."
Augusta and Neville froze, immediately understanding the implications that Lucius hinted.

"Narcissa is the traitor?" the old woman hissed, bloodlust in her eyes.

"It is likely, Augusta," Lucius answered calmly.
"A new Triad is emerging, and I would like you to be the third, until we find and train an heir."

"Who is the second one?"

"Severus Prince, formerly known as Severus Snape."

Augusta nodded weakly, and Lucius explained what he expected of the Alliance.
The evening went calcmly, and the day of the ball arrived quickly, much to quickly for some people's taste.
The Malfoy manor ballroom started to get filled from five o'clock, one hour before the official start.
The room, a large vaulted room and open to the outside wth two balconies, was lit up with thousands of floating candles, while a small orchestra played in a corner.
The men all were elegant and sober formal robes, while the womens paraded around in splendid colorful outfits.
House Elves in waiter uniforms passed inbetween the guests to distribute beverages and canapés.

At precesely six, Lucius and Narcissa appeared up the stairs that linked the ballroom to the rest of the manor, and the hundred or so guests turned their attention to both of them, falling into a respectful silence.

"Everyone welcome to our wonter solstice ball," Lord Malfoy declared, impressive in his grey silk robes, embroidered with silver patterns, holding his stately cane.
Narcissa, wearing a sheath dress of the same colour, stayed slightly behind her husband.

"Welcome to this Saturnalia evening," Lucius continued.
"May the stars protect you for this coming year, and may them bring you wealth and prosperity.
I know you all read the programme that was sent with the invitation, but let me repeat it.
After all, it is a characteristic that appears as we age, and I am not a youngster any more!"

Some laughs could be heard in the room.

"The solstice ceremony will happen in the gardens at eleven.
I dare hope none of you forgot to bring winter flowers, as my dear wife loves her flowerbeds, please refrain from picking the Yule roses or the jasmines, or I cannot guarantee your survival."

Numerous laughs rose up as Narcissa looked daggers at her husband.
Lucius simply smiled and raised his hands to ask for silence.

"I know wish to present several people.
Many close relations saw their children reach the age to appear in society, including my son and heir.
Ladies and Gentlemen, let me present you Draco Lucius Malfoy!"

Draco appeared, a perfect copy of his father in his dark green formal robes, highlighting his pale skin and grey eyes.
His hair was perfectly tidy, no strand was out of place, and his bearing was perfect.
He placed himself between his parent,s who both placed a hand on his shoulders, before how deeply bowed to the guests who all stared at him.

Many clapped at his first appearance as heir in a society ball.
Narcissa and Draco moved aside to get to the Malfoy patriarch's right-hand side.

"Because of the friendship I have with their families, and the one my son has with their heirs, let me present you Vladmir Vassilievitch Kemenov, and Neville Franck Longbottom."

The two children appeared with their respective guardians.
Vladmir wore a deep purple Russian-style stately outfit enhanced by dark fur, while Kaya wore a long, lavander Elizabethan dress, lifted by a cream shawl that made her admirable.
On the contrary, Neville wore perfectly-adjusted black wizard robes, remarkable by its simplicity, and Augusta, far from her usual excentic outfits, wore a blue, sobre evening gown, as simple as her grandson's.

Whispers rose up, but many clapped as both bowed the same way Draco did, before joining the half-circle that started to form behind them.
It was official, the Malfoys, Longbottoms and Kemenovs were allied.

"Finally, let me present you two friends of my son.
Although their blood is not pure, their magic is powerful, and their knowledge of our world deserve our admiration.
They are the perfect example of what our class expect from Muggle-Borns, pure and simple acceptation of our traditions and values.
I thus wish you would welcome Hermione Jane Granger and Kevin Warren Entwhistle among us."

A thick silence fell when the two Muggle-Borns entered, all eyes focused on the details of her arrival.
Kevin wore robes that was stronger than his eyes' colour, and nobly walked in, his bearing worthy of a Malfoy, his face locked in a neutral mask.
At his side, Hermione gracefully walked, with her back perfectly straight and her chin up, a sweet smile on her lips.
Her hair had been tamed in sliken locks that cascaded on her pink Empire silhouette dress, a pale colour that all unmarried girl should wear, leaving the bright colours to the married women.
Sergei, who accompanied them, wore the traditional Russian outfit.

Kevin perfectly did his bow, while Hermione simply elegantly bowed her head, and a slow clap suddenly started.
One after the other, every guest followed, even if some did not seem to enjoy the presentations.

"I think you for your attention, and now declare that the Saturnalia ball is open!"

As it was their first presentation, and the Hermione was the only girl of their age, she was asked for a dance from each of her friends.
They had to go around the dance floor at least once, and Vladmir handed her over to Kevin for a wizarding waltz.
Kevin did well, considering that he had only learned this dance on month before, as did Hermione.
The fact that they had learned together allowed them to mitigate the small errors they showed.

IN the corner of his eyes, the young Russian saw Lucius and his Potions professor arrived.
He took a class of fruit juice and smiled slightly.

"I think you all know my friend Severus Prince," Lucius declared with a clear voice, making sure all around him heard.

"Nobility suits you," Vladmir asked, amused.
"No black?
I am shocked."

He had to admit that Severus Snape, now Prince, was changed, in his deep blue formal zobes.
Getting out of his laboratory and the school was beneficial for him.
Gone was the greasy hair, now in a ponytail, and he was tanner than usual.

"Don't tell me about it.
Lucius dragged me to every shop in London to find outfits for someone of my stature.
Had he not been my friend, I would have cursed him before long."

"Prodessor Snape?" an incredulous voice asked.

"Mr. Weasley?" Severus was astonished as he observed Charlie standing in front of them, impressive in his formal outfit and the burns on his face.
What are you doing at this soirée?"

"Indeed, Mr. Weasley," the readhead said with a bitter smile.
"The English aristocracy tends to forget that the Weasley are a noble family, you are not the first one to ask me.
To answer your question, I come to shown a friend my support.
Lord Malfoy, I had not been able to thank you for your invitation yet."

"It is my pleasure, Mr. Weasley."

"Is that a criticism of your parents in your words?"
Admittedly, one could not tell they were noble when meeting them.

"In no way, Lord Prince.
My parents are, pardon my French, brilliant, and I like living in the Burrow.
We are far from rich, although some should remember that the Weasleys and Prewettsa re old Pure-Blodod families, and that if we came back, our political voice could be dangerous with the right alliances."

"I would not have thought I would hear a Weasley talk about politics," Lucius intervened, surpried.
"Although your brothers admittedly greatly surprised me this year."

"Are you thinking about Ronald?" Charlie asked, astonished.

"Merlin no!" Lucius laughed, catching his guests' attention at this rare occurrence.
"I was thinking about Frederic and George.
Despite the discord with your father, they helped my son when he needed it."

"Ron evoked a particularly thrilling match," Charlie nodded, not saying that his young brother had regretted that Malfoy Jr. did not get more injured.
However, from the sparkle in Lucius's eyes, the Lord knew what the youngest Wealseyl meant.

"Do tell Chalres, as second heir, will you take the name and titles of the Prewetts?"

"I Have discussed this with the matriarch, and she is favourable," Charlie nodded again,holding back a smiled.
He was not used to being called Charls any more, except by her mother when she was livid.
However, no nickname was allowed in the aristocracy, as an unwritten rule.

"Although Muriel Prewett is of an advanced age, she is still lucid," Severus declared.
"It is good to know that this line will stay extent after her demise."

"Very well.
Gentlemen, I have to greet many guests, I will see you again later with pleasure."

Charlie then walked away with Severus Snape and Sergei to talk calmly, as the five children fled to a corner to get some peace and let Kevin grumbled how nightmarish a ball was.
Fortunately, he had to admit that the Saturnalia ceremony had brightened up the evening.
All guests had assembled in the perfectly maintained gardens, the snow strangely gone.
It was easy to see the powerful magical faults on which the manor was built, and whose power had greatly inscreased with the solstice.
The flowers were offerings to Magia, who accepted it by making them disappear of the antique altar that was in the middle of the gardens.

Needless to say, Hermione and Kevin were fascinated, surveilled closely but discreetly by Sergei and Vladmir.
To their relief, Hermione had no reaction to the sudden pure magic wave that pulsed through the place.
They would have had a hard time to explain the phenomenon without explaining Hermione's magical nature...

The ball ended at midnight, as was customary.
Some Muggle tales also followed this trope, and it had made Hermione laugh, evoking some 'Cinderella'.

<hr>

The two Kemenov were tired, and both were calmly sitting on the chaise longue in their suite's drawing room in Malfoy manor.

They had changed back to more usual clothes, and were not ending their night calmly, despite the late hour.
They were on holidays, after all.
Katya was holding a book, as her nephew was napping, his head on her lap.
Sergei had left them, officially for a quick patrol, although the two Russians suspected him of hunting for a good mean.
Many single people had attended the ball, and many were still in the manor, about to leave.
He would not have a problem to seduce and bite a naive young woman and get a few drops of blood...
Unless he preferred young men this time, as he sometimes did...

*"Hey, Katya..."*

*"Yes?"*

Vladmir huddled up more on his aunt's lap, sighing with ease when she started sratching his hair.

*"What is going on with Lucius?"*

The young woman's hand froze for a second, becore going back to the dance inside her nephew's hair.
Vlad closed his eyes and was soothed by the soft motion, wating for his aunt to answer.

*"What made you think that there was something going on?"*

*"You blushed when Agusta talked about you and Sergei.
As if you were embarassed.
And Lucius reacted.
I think he was jealous."*

*"You are way to observing for your own good,"* Katya sighed.
*"There will be nothing between Lucius and me."*

*"You would like to, wouldn't you?"*

*"Yes,"* Katya ansered after a long pause.
*"However..."*

*"Lucius is married.
He is faithful to his oath, and you won't make him break it,"* Vlad continued for her, nestling aginst Katya's hips, putting his head against her stomach.
He could hear her heart beats, appeasing him.

*"Exactly."*

*"Then may he divorce,"* Vlad whispered, slowly drifting to sleep.
*"You are allowed hapiness...
He has enough...
reasons...
to..."*

Katya smiled tenderly when she noted that her nephew started sleeping against her.
A renewed wave of love for Vladmir went straight to her heart, and she softly brushed the small scar on his cheek, observing his relaxed face.
He had grown up since he entered Hogwarts, his face thinning to take the traits of adolecence.
His hair had grown some more, and he attached them in a thin braid now.

She got up, making sure not to wake Vladmir up, and picked him up as delicately.
With a silent spell, the door to his room opened, and the sheets were pulled.
She put him in the middle of the bed, and pulled the covers on him, before softly kissing him.

*"Sleep well kitten."*

*"'night..."* Vlad's sleepy voice answered.

"Katya looked at him for a few seconds, melancholic, as her turned on his belly and pushed his arms under the pillow.
James slept exactly like that when they were teenagers and they found a way to see each other in secret during the holidays...
A sweet smile streached her lips, and she brushed his hair one last time bfore walking out the bedroom.
