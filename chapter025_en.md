# Chapter 25: Stories about nobility

Hermione was smiling.
She coul just not not smile, not after the end of the Defence Against the Dark Arts lecture.
Ronald, even if he had calmed down a bit since a few days before -- and she had to thank Fred and George to make him understan indirectly that the more he would insult her, the more he would be a test subject -- had just had the fright of his life.

"You seem quite happy, Granger."

Hermione smirked when she greeted Draco, who was waiting in front of the Great Hall door for dinner.
The young Pure-Blood raised an eyebrow, surprised to see on her face an expression he was more used to seeing on Valdmir's face or even his.
As a model Slytherin, he did not ask her about it, knowing she would eventually talk about it.
He only galantly reached out his arm, and Hermione laughed at his manners, letting herself be led to the Ravenclaw table, the neutral one.

They regularly ate together, but the cohoice of the table had been a survival choice for Hermione and Neville.
Going to the Gryffindors, where they were already treated like pariahs because of their friendship with the prince of Slytherins, was simply out of the question.
As for going to the Slytherins, it was not a problem for that House, according to Draco.
He had discreetly investigated to know if the presence of two Muggle-Borns and lions offended someone.
Some protestations had been raised, but Draco was a Malfoy, and one had better not cross the heir of the family.
No one had been particularly vindictive, but Kevin had said that going to the enemy would worsend the relationship Hermione and Neville had with their own House.
Thus, there only was the Ravenclaw table left, as they did not know the Hufflepuffs enough to allow themselves to invade their space.

Kevin and Vladmir already had their appetizers in front of them, lively talking with fourth and fifth years on an obscure subject of ancestral magic.
Bradley, who still wore his Prefect insigna, smiled when he saw the second years coming.

"Whell, what are a lion and a snake doing in enemy territory?" he joked, pushing himself away to leave some space for them.

"I's say it's rather neutral territory," a small dreamy voice said.
"May I?"

Bradley, focused on his conversation, jumped when he realized that a small first-year blond girl was standing behind him.
Luna still had her day bag and a necklace made of multi-coloured threads, on which a monocle served as a pendant, adorning her neck.
He smiled as he stood up to leave his spot to the girl.

"See you later.
You'll be more at ease with a bit more space and not packed like sardines!"

"'Packed like sardines'?" Draco noted.

"Muggle expression," Hermione sighed.
"When will you dare learn something about my world?"

"When Leprechauns become bankers!" Draco retorted.
"I'm perfectly at ease in the magical world, I have no reason to lose myself amogst the Muggles.

Meanwhile, Luna had sat down next to Vladmir, who was observing her helping herself, keeping immobile and with an expressionless face that heavily contrasted with the young Ravenclaw's dreamy face.
Luna seemed to feel his stare, and raised her eyes to look at his.

"You seem quite happy, Mione," Kevin said, unknowingly used Draco's exact words from a few minutes before;
Kevin was following from the corner of his eyes the exchange between the two eagles, curious of Vladmir's behaviour, but Hermione's extatic face and her amused sneer were to rare not to ask about.

"Did you know Ronald was afraid of spiders?" Hermione exclaimed.

"I did," Neville said, sitting down next to his Housemate, covered in dirt after the time he spent in the Greenhouses.
"He had quite the panic attack at the start of the year when he woke up to see an innocent harvest spider.
I don't know which one was the most afraid between the small creature that ran as fast as its legs could go, and him...
But today's reaction was not bad as well!"

"What do you mean?" Draco eagerly asked, not wanting to lose an occasion to scare off the redhead.
He spent his time teasing Ronald, who immediately got angry, to the delight of the young Malfoy's friends.
Hermione explained to them that according to Ronald, the rivalry between their families started generations ago, in an obscure affair about marraiges that provoked the Weasleys' ruin.
It made Draco laugh out loud, as he had a very different version.
None of his friends tried to take sides in those rivalries, prefereing to observe the exchanges.

Well, he made quite maginicient vocalizations while running the fastest sprint in Hogwarts' history," Neville explained.

"Because of a small spider?" Vladmir aksed, surprised.

"Not one...
A small line of diverse arachnids, from a cupboard harvest spider, to one of the big cave spiders."

"That confirms our suspicions," Kevin whispered.

Their research material said that spiders fled as quickly as possible from a Basilisk.
It confirmed Vladmir's hypothesis about the presence of a snake king in the castle.

Two readheads passed by at this moment behind them, making dubious puns and accidentally shoving Vlad.
The Russian smiled as he discreetly put a note in his pocket, note that had suddenly appeared underneath his plate like by magic.

"They did not find it," Luna whispered as she observed a group of visibly furious Slytherin seventh years, all wearing a magnificient scarlet and gold mane, and walking briskly towards the twins.
Vlad, the only one to hear her words, tilted his head while looking back to her blue eyes.
She knew things she should not, and it intrigued him.
His behaviour, quite peculiar, immediately caught his friends' attention.
Kevin, who was following this exchange since the beginning, quickly tried to get their attention.

"So, Draco, ready for tomorrow's match?"
