## Chapter 22: Magical Duel

Katya walked through the council room, worried.
Sergei had just sent her a not to ask her to get to the Kemenov Palace as soo as possible.
The coded message was stamped "urgent", which was alarming in itself.

She nodded goodbye to the other two members of the Russian Triad after excusing herself.
She had to leave them alone to receive grievances from members of the Mirage Court as well as exterior sollicitations, numerous following the break-up of the former Tirad of Easter Europe.
However, Katya knew that if their opinions diverged, Xi-Mo and Anthrecna, the two Triads, would wait her return to close a case.
It was not arbitrary for the Courts to be lead by an odd number of leaders.

She pulled her hood up once she walked out of the council room door, masking her identity under the official black cape of the Mirage Court.
She kept the anonymity of members thanks to several specific spells, only showing the Court they were attached to with the coat-of-arms embroidered on the back.
Katya was wearing the symbol of the Russian branch [overlooked] by the crown with three diamonds signalling her as a Truad.
The trims of her sleeves and hood were also a symbol representing her class.
Grey as neutrality for Politicians, red as blood for Mercenaries, yellow as gold for Smugglers.

Some knew her, most ignored who their fellows were.
Only the Triads knew everyone, because you needed the unanimous approval of all three leaders to join.

Katya walked the dark hallways of the _Semirrov_ headquarters, distractedly responding to the greetings she got.
In a few minutes, she left the premices through a series of stairs through the main door.
The entrace of the _Semirrov_ headquarters used a warm, large inn on the Red Square in Moscow, ironically a few strides away from the entrance to the Russian Ministry for Magic.
The official Apparition area of the government, public toilets closed for anyone but wizards, witches or magical creatures, was also used by the Mirage Court.
Katya opened the toilets door and immediately Disappeared.

"*Katya* "
"*Hello Nikolai.
You know what is happening?* " the clan chief asked without being surprised by the presence of the vampired in the small alleyway where the wizards and witches who wanted to get to the Kemenovs' arrived.

The Vampire nodded, but refused to say anything before Katya came into their domain.
She was surprised to see Fredrich, one the Sergei's men, a efl-human mix, step out of the shadows and escort her for the hundred metres or so to the entryway of the Kemenov palace.

It was this increasingly worried that Katya came into her home and walked to her private office, where the vampired charged with the Clan safety waited for her.
The young woman slammed the door shut after Nikolai walked into the room, and she sat down behind her office, which was swarmed with piles of papers, nonchalantly throwing her cape on a chaise longue in a corner of the room.

" *Well, I repeat my question: what is happening?* " she said firmly while looking at the two vampires in front of her.

"*We have news from Vladmir.* "

"*I am suprised I did not have a message...* "

"*He sent it to Sergei directly, as he was afraid you blew up the palace before you readhis letter to the end,*" Nikolai whispered. "*There are good news, bad news...*"

"*And very bad news,*" Sergei completed.

"*Start with good news if there are very bad news, I probably won't be in any state to her the good,*" Katya admitted.
She knew her temper, and if her nephew was threatened or had grave problems, she could react very badly.
Vladmir had foresight.

"*Vlad started his mission with the support of Neville Longbottom, and does not have any particular problem."

"*Augusta and Lucius both wish for the _Underground_ to live again,*" Katya agreed.
"*I have gotten news recently, and they had good results on their side.
Licius contacted former members, and how fortunate that he had been a Triad, otherwise the whole network would have been lost...
Has Vladmir got any concrete results?*"

"*Indeed.
He has gotten his hand on an outcast of the Irish Court, Marcus O'Balley.
He sent you a copy of the magical contract binding them, and wants you to denounce him as soon as he quits or gets fired from Hogwarts.
The contract is clean, he risks nothing if you sell him to the Irish Court.*"

"*How did he find this guy?" Katya asked, surprised.
Vlad definitely had a gift to find troubles...

"*No idea.
To say the truth, his face is totally different to the one on the wanted poster, but that's logical, since they used the _Reverso Identitis_ spell.*"

"*How much is the reward?*"

"*700 Galleons,*" Nikolai smiled.

Katya nodded and asked for what was next.
Quickly, Sergei explained her how he got into the Hogwarts smuggling network.

"*He is their new supplier, and wants you to get them supplies at market price with the Clan's wholesalers.
I took the liberty to answer favourably myself.
He will send the first few orders some time this week."

"*Good... any other good news?*"

The two vampires smile contritely and looked at each other, while Katya sighed and passed a hand through her short, wild hair.
She knew she would not like what would follow.
And when Sergei started by telling her the fortunate meeting between Vlad and Narcissa Malfoy in the middle of St-Petersburg's magical quarters, she felt trouble brewing.

Actually, she should have accepted that Vlad went to Durmstrang, or even better... being homeschooled.
After all, she had the necessary tutors in the Clan...
Distractedly, lost in her thoughts, she heard two names.

"*What?*" she yelled, standing up.
"*Malfoy knows Dolohov and Darerine?*"

The two vampires tried to appease her, but Katya did not listen to them at first.
Those two ere Dark Mages.
Although Lady Dolohov was gifted in Dark Magic and an extraordinary orator, able to gather crowds under her banner by her sheer presence, Darerine was even worse.
His mastery of necromancy was terrifying and he was able to materialize corpses which were decomposing for centuries and manipulate them like the genius pupetteer he was.
If Merlin's tomb was known, this man would have had the dubiously humourous idea to reaimate Merlin's corpse and pupet it...

"*Katya!*"

THe young woman observed Sergei standing in front of her.
She slowly blinked, and the objects flying around her slowly went back to their prior positions as she regained her mastery of her magic.
It had been a while since the last time she lost control like that.
THe Kemenov matriarch noticed the worried look of the two vampires and softly reassured them.

"*Well... Narcissa Malfoy has also introduced something in Hogwarts.
Apparently, it is a Dark magic artefact that probably used to belong to Voldemort.
Vlad doesn't know more about that, bu he has heard strange voices in the corridors.*"

Katya closed her eyes for a fraction of a second, then stood up quickly, jaws clenched, walking as quickly as possible to her personal chimney.

"*Wait Katya,*" sergei exclaimed while standing between her and the chimney.
He knew exactly what his clan chief wanted to do.
"*Lucius Malfoy doesn't know.*"

"You're kidding, right?*" Katya growled.
"*Narcissa is his wife under the ancient laws!*"

"He. knows. nothing.*" Sergei slowly articulated.
"*The House elf assured Vlad that its mistress was the only one implicated.*"

Katya did not put two and two together at first.
The House Elf... It was probably Dobby...
So he was linked to House Malfoy, and Vlad probably used the young Draco's status as heir in order to get information, bypassing Narcissa's orders.
In that case, she had to talk to Lucius quickly.

Katya observed Sergei for a bit, before nodding and sitting back at her desk, a sure sing that she was in a bad mood, and she fet it was only the beginning.

"*Wait, you said Vlad heard voices?*" she whispered as the information was processed by her mind once it was slightly clear from the fog of anger.

Nikolai noded, and she sighed while rubbing her forehead.
This kid knew how to drive her crazy...

"*Annyway*," she continued.
"*How many bad news like that remain?"

Sergei slowly breathed in and locked gaze with Katya.
The young woman felt a tinge in her stomach.
He only used the vampiric soul eyes to announce the worst news.

"*Karzkern challenged Vladmir in the name of the Fedovir clan, using the ancient imperial duelling laws.*"

Katya exploded.

Half the furniture of her office were shattered.
Glass fragments scattered in the room, injuring the to vampired despite the woman's instinctive magic's protection.
A glacial wind rose up, as everything fle arounf her.
Katya vaguely heard cries in the palace, her people probably alerted by the discharge of raw magic.
But she could only think of one thing.

Karzkern had challenged her nephew, her kitten...
One of the harshest mercenaries in Russia had challenged the heir to Clan Kemenov.

A man with 30 yers of duelling and Dark Magic experience had challenged a 12 year-old by, still learning, following the imperial rules.

And Vladmir, as heir, could not refuse this duel.

A public duel, only prohibiting direct death curses.
A no holds barred duel, where all kinds of magic were allowed.

Vladmir risked death for the honour of a despisable clan who could not sustain a war.
Katya trusted her nephew and his magical ability, but she was afraid.
Afraid he would be graveluy injured, or worse...

When she got her attention back on Sergei, the vampire could not hold back an uneasy shiver.
Katya had put on her war mask, and when her voice rose up, his oath of alliegeance made him kneel before her, as did Nikolai, and the ten or so people who looked in from outside the office.

"*I, Katya Anapovna Kemenov, swear on my magic that I will destroy Clan Fedovir if Vlad dies during this duel,*" Katya said, her voice filled with power from the grave, her eyes glowing with hatred.

All trembled, however could do but accept the Vow.
The members of Clan Kmenow -- man, woman, child, soldier, or mere servant - felt deep within their magic that their leader has started a clan war.

Then Katya turned her gaze towards the small group outside the door and made them flee with a simple look.
The Dark magical aura shining around her was terrifying, and she got her attention back towards the two till kneeling vampires.

"*When?*"

"*Tomorrow morning, in Hogwarts' Great Hall.
Vladmir, following the rules, chose the judges.
He chose Goblin Master Filius Flitwick and Lucius Malfoy.*"

"*Good.
Nokolai, summon Fredrich and Borislav.
You have one hour.
Have them ready for combat."

The vampired immediately disappeared to carry out the order.
In one hour, the soldiers would be present and ready to go to war.
Katya observed her destroyed office with a detached eye, then motioned for Sergei to follow her.

The campired obeyed and followed her to her appartments.
He saw her disappear for a few minutes in her bedromm, and Katya walked out with her combat cape, armed to the teeth.
A few seconds afterwards, they entered Vladmir's domain, more precisely his dressing room, where his niece opened an isolated wardrobe.
He carefully took the outfit on which the unique belt laid, as well as the impeccably folded combat robes.
In one felt swoop, she put the robes made out of accromentula silk and protections made out od dragon leather in a bag, before taking the suspended satchel, then the stylets and daggers that Sergei had grown accustomed to during his training sessions with Vlad.

---

Thirty minutes later, Katya was standing in the entry hall of the palace, the three dozen other inhabitants silently standing behind her and her suite.
Children stayed hiddden behind their mothers skirts, scared by Katya's aura, as she had always been warm to them before, as well as the adults' serious faces.

"*Lady Kemenov...*"

Katya turned an expressionless face to the new Kemenov stewardess, as the previous one dies of her wounds during the last Clan war.

"*Please transmit our support to Vladmir Vassilievitch.
We all root for him.
He is a strong and powerful young man, noble and just.
He deserves to win, and we would stand behind him if allowed to.
Tell him we will wait for him this winter with a somptuous meal celebrating his victory.*"

Katya unnoticeably nodded, as all strongly supported the young stewardess.
She would transmit this memory to Vladmir a few hours before his duel to mentally support him.
The matriarch knew how important the support of the Clan was to Vladmir's spirit and will to live.
The whole Clan was behind him, believing in his victory.
He could not help but win to thank them for their confidence.

The door flew open, showing Fredrich, Nikolai, and a third immensly tall and powerfull-built man, with long, pure-white hair in a loose plait.
Like Katya, both humans wore combat outfits.

"*Good, let's go!*"

Katya waved at her Clan, delegating her leadership to Andrei, the fourth person in the clan's hierarchy, right after Sergei, giving him a message to transmit to the Mirage Court, announcing that the problems were serious enough to warrant her unforeseen absence.
Then, getting to the dark alley behind the palace, the group Disappeared towards the St-Ptersburg ministry.

---

"*I don't care about the price,*" Katya declared with a glacial voice to the employee charged with international transports, who seemed tired.
"*I demand an international Portkey to Hogsmead, Scotland, for five passengers.*"

"*But Lady Kemenov...*"

"*Enough!
Bring me to the department's manager!*" Katya thundered, exasperated after ten minutes of useless discussions, sending a cold wave on the employees around her, all of whom shivered uneasily.
Whispers could be heard behind them, and the Kemenov matriarch turned to the three employees peeked from the corridor.
She looked daggers at them, threatening, then her eyes caught sight of a silver plaque stamped with the international symbol of magical transports behind them.

Without any word, she walked away from the front desk and towards the door, followed by her four followers who seemed rather indimidating in their combat uniform embroidered with Kemenov coat-of-arms.
The three employees yelped and hid against the walls to let them through.

"*Wait, you can't got there!*"

Katya ignored the panicked voice of the employee, and knocked sharply at the door stamped "Ivan Verskovski, Director of the Department of International Transports, Federal District of Saint-Petersburg."

"*Come in!*" a voice muffled by the door rang.

Katya opened the door, and sa a man she knew well, as she had met him in several evening receptions and balls of the Russian high society.
On seeing her, Verkovski stood up and walked around his desk with a smile on his face, then put his hands on the young woman's shoulder to kis both her cheeks.

"*Katya Annapovna!*"

"*Ivan Afonovitch.*"

"*Sir, I'm deeply sorry, this woman...*"

The Director turned to see his employee try to pass by Katya's men and frowned.

"*This woman is the matriarch of Clan Kemenov.
I know her well and she can disturb me whenever she likes, Nanosko.*"

Then, without looking any more at his subordinate, the tall Russian with great sideburns looked more closely at Katya's outfit, noting the combat robes and her war face.

"*Please reassure me, Katya Annapovna.
You are not here to start a clan war, are you?*"

The last clan war involving the Kemenovs had made quite the impression in all Magical Russia, and rumours had crossed the frontiers.
The attack on the clan, unforeseen but won by the powerful family, had provoked both amiration and anger.
Families from the old nobility had warmly congratulated the Kemenov Clan, one of the very few ones led by a strong woman, while the people's magical families had cried foul when they had discovered that such inhumane and barbaric customs still existed.

"*I am not.
Unless my heir dies in the duel started by Clan Fedovir.*"

"*Vladmir Vassilievitch had been challenged?*" the Director of International Transports asked with a blank voice.
He remembered the shy eight-year-old boy during his presentation ball, and he did not imagine this adorable child fight in a duel, even if he was now twelve, and the nephew to one of the best duellists in Russia.

"*By Boris Pietrovitch Karzkern.*"

"*You wish to go to the location of the duel,*" the man immediately understood.
If he remembered correctly, the kid would study either in Durmstrang, or another European magical school.
The Kemenov matriarch would have never let her hair study in Oska, the Russian school who was ranked among the last ones in the world, based on their results.

He only needed to get the address of the destination and he sent an urgent message to the Bearers, a guild whose members alone had the knowledge and magical power to create international Portkeys.

A few minutes and thanks later, their pockets way lighter from the cost of the Portkey, the five wizards were waiting for the arrival of their Portkey in the room reserved for international departures.
A young woman with long, blond hair met them, wearing the purple robes of the Bearers, and gave them a small broken mirror.

"*Urgent departure scheduled in five minutes,*" the woman declared without greeting anyone there.

The employee charge with registration for the departures tapped his book with his wand and inscribed the identities of the travelers, the time of departure and their destination.
He was finishing the records when their Portkey triggered.

Katya, leaving like that, did not suspect that their arrival would stay in memories in Hogwarts.
Thanks to the Director of International Transports, they appeared right in front of Hogwarts' gate.
Even though the imposing gate made of forged iron was closed, Katya turned to the two vampires, who undertood what she wanted without her talking.
They took the three humans' arms into their own before transforming.
Taking their original shape, Nokolai and Sergei freed their vampiric powers and transformed into an invisible mist.

---

Vladmir was staying silent, sitting in the middle of the Ravenclaws, as numerous students wispered behind his back.
He felt theor looks, and it made him furious.
The only thing making him happy was the sincere worry of his friend and House.

The young Russian had not said a word after he had accepted the duelling challenge the previous evening, except for saying who the judges would be.
Katya could not be chose, and neither could any of the members of clan Kemenov, for obvious preference concerns.
He had thus chose his Head of House, one of the best duelists in Europe and a secret ally, as well a Lucius Malfoy.
Karzkern had tried to discredit Flitwick, but to Vlamdir's surprise, Dumbledore had supported him.
Although, it would embarrass Dumblediore to see the Boy-Who-Lived so close to dying in a duel...

Anyway, Lucius was sitting at the high table and was talking with Severus Snape, who was looking at the young Russian.
They were in a lively discussion, pretected by a silence charm, and seeing the Potions professor berating another Slytherin and known Death Eater seemed to surprise many people.

Vladmir had vaguely noted this, playing with the purée in his plate.
He had not been able to eat anything during the mean;
His aunt had not responsed, nor had Sergei, whom he had sent his letter to, and it was worrying him more than anything.
Was it that Clan Fedovir had started a war?
Lost in his purée and his unanswered questions, he jumped when he heard terryfied cries.

He raised his head and sighed with relief.
He stood up and quickly went around the table to get to his family.
Katya and her men had suddenly appeared in the middle of the Great Hall, even though Appearing in Hogwarts was theoretically imposible.
The cold faces of the five visitors, their quasi-militaristic outifts, and their weapons did not any doubt as to their intentions.

Not caring about etiquette, Vladmir went to snuggle his aunt, who wrapped her arms around his shoulders to squeeze him against her.

"*Kitty,*" she whispered, "*we need to talk...*"

"What do you want?" Dmubledore asked, focusing the attention of the six wiwzards and witches.

"This man is more stupid than you said, prince Vladmir," Fredrich slowly declared with a thick Russian accent.

"We are here to witness the duel of the heir to our clan," Sergei announced, looking at the professors.

"The duel is tomorrow," Minerva McGonagall contested.

"So, you allow the presence of two mercenaries, including one coming to challenge a student, but disallow said student's family?" Nikolai growled

Indeed, in a far corner of the Great Hall, the two mercenaries of Clan Fedovir were peacefully eating, under the attentive gaze of the two aurors.
Albus frowned, but his smile and the sparkle in his eyes came back quickly.
He did not want to alienate the Kemenov Clan yet again, especially not in front of Lucius Malfoy, who had lobbied the Board of Governers to fire him since the previous school year.

"You are welcome here, I am more surprised of your numbers."

Katya looked daggers ar him, then let go of her nephew before walking out of the Great Hall, under the whispers of all students.
They had much to discuss before the next morning.
Vladmir waved reassuringly at his friends, who all sighed in relief at seeing him smile for the first time since the previous evening.

"*Where is your common room, Kity?*" Katya asked, stopping in the huge Hogwarts entry hall.

Vlad smiled at her again and Sergei rolled his eyes, passing a hand through the tied hair of the young Ravenclaw.

"*Oi! Don't!" the young Russian groaned.

"*Finally, I thought they had cut off your tongue!*"

Vladmir mumbled as he tied his hair back and he guided the small group towards the Ravenclaw wing.
The adults took in the sight before going to Vlad's room.

The rest of the evening went way to fast to Vlad's liking.
Katya took the time to reassure him and whisper long words of comfort as he finally allowed himself to show fear, pretected by his aunt's arms.
She show him the memory of her departure and the confidence that the entire clan gave him, which made her nephew cry again.

The Kemenov matriarch, her heart heavy, reassured and consoled her heir, and did not try to ask him questions.
However, she had to take care of certain things with the Hogwarts Headmaster, namely their accomodation and the rules of the duel...
So for Vlad's sake and the ability for her to meet the Headmaster relatively peacefully, she made her nephew drink a Potion for Dreamless Sleep.

"*Borislav, Nikolai, watch Vlad's sleep.
Sergei, Fredrich, with me.*"

The Russian woman walked out of the room and came face-to-face with Kevin, who was distractedly petting his friend small ice viper.
The young boy, sitting on the ground in front of the door, slowly stood up to face her.
Worry shined in his blue eyes, and Katya softly nodded, telling him that Vlad was sleeping.
Kevin thanked her with a nod and entered his bedroom, softly hissing Parsletongue words at the snake.

Katya did not sleep that night.
She talked for a big part of the night with the respresentatives of the Russian and British Aurors about the restrictions on magic.
Vladmir, as a Russian citizen, would be able to use all legal magic in his country, including Dark Magic.
The Headmaster could not object to his use of Dark Magic.
However, the written consent of the Board of Governors was needed for this.
Katya thus was in negotiations after midnight with the twelve members of the Board.
Lucius Malfoy was very helpful, as was Augusta Longbottom.
Presumably, seeing those two whose hostility was legendary cooperate convinced the rest of the Governors.
They had tried to forbid the presence of minor students during the duel, but that was outright refused.
It would be a great example according to Dumbledore, who was thinking about creating a duelling club...

---

The next day, Katya and her men were sitting in the best spots, serious and tired.
The Russian witch observed the stands fill up of laughing, amused students, not knowing how brutal the fight would be.
The Headmaster and the professors were incompetent idiots, as were the Board of Governors...

She gave her nephew's friends a small smile.
Draco stayed with his House, as did Kenvin, while Hermione and Neville were sitting together with a Gryffindor read-head that she did not know.
All seemed worried and paler than usual.
They all knew how bad Vladmir had been affected after his first year's winter holidays.
They knew part of what physical and psychological damaged the clan war had done...
They were afraid to see their friend suffer and die.

The tables had been pushed against the walls, leaving a big duelling arena.
Runes had been engraved on the ground by the Charms and Study of Ancient Runes professors.
Once activated, they would protect the spectators from stray spells.

A 9 o'clock precisely, Karzkern and Vladmir entered, making the crown whisper.
While Kazrkern was wearing a standard mernecary outfit, Vladmir had put on the Clan Kemenov combat outfit that Katya had brought him.
He wore trousers and boots made of black dragon leather, a tunic made of a skars mesh, a Goblin-made metal, reinforced with magic.
His combat cape, deep green and made out of Accromentula silk, spell-resistant, was embroidered with both the Kemenov and Potter coats-of-arms.
Although the impressive outfit in itself was intriguing, the members of Clan Kemenov also heard a lot a questions about the presence of potions and sharp daggers, as did the asence of wands.

The two wizards placed themselves in front of each other, and the two judges, Lucius Malfoy and Filius Flitwick placed themselves so as to form a square of them four.
They wore deep black conventional robes for the occation.
Their role, in this type fo duels, was minimal, exclusively based on observation.
They were charged with noticing the spells used in order to adapt the medical treatment at the end of the combat.
The only way they would intervene was to disqualify one of the duellists for the use of a death curse, or if one of them was relentlessly attacking his unconscious opponent.
However, any order from them was as strong as an Imperium curse, and the opponents would freeze, bound by magic.

Katya was clenching her jaws while looking at the stands.
All of Hogwarts' student body would be here, and the Professors had deployed around the Hall, looking over their students.
Dumbledore was present, as friendly as ever, full of concern and solicitude.
Besides him, a small round man, a bowler hat in his hands, was flanked by  two Aurors.
Katya nudged Sergei and pointed her chin towards the two British waizards

"*Cornelius Fudge,*" the vampired whispered, frowning.
"*What is he doing here?*"

"*I suspect him of wanting to improve his image by being here,*" Katya groaned, staring at the British Minister for Magic.

"*Sure, he isn't popular at all in the polls, but to appear in Hogwarts...*"

"*Vlad is still Harry Potter,*" Borislav cut him, "*even if it pisses us off, he's their fucking Boy-Who-Lived.*"

"*Language Boris,*" Nikolai grumbled.
"*Or don't complain about Vlad's vocabulary afterwards.*"

"*I'm still wondering about his presence next to Dumbledore.
Fudged shot him down during the trial, and the old oneusually has got a nagging grudge.*"

"*They have been too calm after the trials, Dumbledore must be preparing something.*"

"*Don't talk about misfortune, Fredrich,*" Katya nearly hissed while looking daggers at the old mage, knowing her subordinate was not wrong.
The Headmaster's schemes from the start of Vladmir's first year had sudenly stopped, without any clear reason, like he had lost virtually everything.
She noted to investigate Albus Dumbledore's actions since the trial...

"Ladies and Gentlemen," Filius began.
"A duel according to the Russian Empire's rules had been challenged and accepted.
The winner will be the last conscious one.
Not legal duration has been established.
Mister Kazrkern, Mister Kemenov, do you swear to combat honourably?"

The last one conscious, and not the last one standing...
The nuance was minute, but imortant, even if the majority of the students did not recognised it.
Some had become pale, however.

"I swear," both combatants responded, magic flowing out of their words.

"Good.
Gentlemen... Begin!"

No formal greetings, not initial distance, no wand out yet.
The two opponents stared at each other for quite a while, and the room felt heavy when both of their magic deployed.

The first motion was blurry.
The mercenary threw something at Vladmir, who rolled on the ground to avoid three throwing daggers.
They dug into the stone with a dull sound, despite the ground's magical reinforcement.

Vlamdir only stayed silent while Karzkern calle back his daggers with a supple motion.
The boy's gaze was cold and calculating, more adult than his friends had seen him before.

He slowly stood up and moved his hand when the man cautiously approached.
Drops of blood reached the ground and sizzled before disappearing, Vlad's wand springing from his sleeve.

It was Karzkern's turn to quickly avoid the attack, although Valdmir's second spell in the shadow of the first grazed him, a iridescent surface briefly appearing around him.

They tested each other with several ligth spells, noting the quickness, supleness and magical power of their opponent.
The mercenary was using a permanent shield, whil Vladmir used a blood protection, using less magic, but usable only inside where his blood spilled on the ground.
The young Russian did not want to spend too much magic during this first phase.
His spell, pure Dark Magic because it used blood, prompted the professors and som Pure-BLood students to whispered.

Then, the real combat began.
All the experience and knowledge against power and agility.
The two duellists slipped, dodged, twirled around each other, each trying to impose his rythm.
If Vladmir was smaller and more flexible, he had a limited spell catalogue, not wanting to use too much Dark Magic in front of that audience.
And since he was not good at Transfiguration, he was further limited.
He was thus trying to empty the mercenary's reserve of magic while keeping some for the end himself.

Karzkern, did not have this kind of qualms.
Using his knowledge, he chained one hex after the other, all meant to injure the opponent.
He had to admit his opponent was good for his age, but he was still a child.

"*Burn!*"

Vladmir could not dodge all the flamed and even if his outfit took most of the damage, his uncovered wrist was burnt.
A burnt flesh smell rose up, as his dominant hand had deep wounds.

"_Protecto maxima invisibilis!_" Vladmir yelled, using his injured hand to make a complicated gesture, ignoring pain.

A powerful shield activated, and he moved quickly to use a potion.
Pain lessened and he cast a nasty curse himself, followed by a second one that cut his opponent's cape and drew blood.

"*Well, little Kemenov, you're finally getting serious!*", the merecnary laughed.

Around them, the students saw spells chain, all more violent than the last.
Sickening creaking rang out as Vladmir's shield shattered.
The young Russian instinctively pretected his face with his right had, and the power projected him against the runes barrier.
Blood gushed out as his arm's bones went through his skin, as it had taken most of the power of the spell, and he yelled out in pain.

Only his intuition saved him as he took a step to the side.
A charmed blad went through the magical chain mail and his side, as the sneering face of the mercenary appeared a few centimetres from his.

With his valid hand, Vlad took a stylet and plunged it in his opponent's neck, as quickly as a snake, aiming to kill.
Ther mercenary stepped back and the stylet pivoted in the young Russian's hand as he turned around himself to aim for his opponents kidneys.

"_Caro disceptum, liquosanguis!_
*Cauterise!*"

He used the last spell on himself, with his classmates screamed in horror, wand pointed towards the large wound on his flank.
The burnt flesh odour rose again in the Great Hall as he yelped in pain, although not looking away from his opponent.
Karzkern had managed to avoid the second spell, but the first had connected with his hip and right leg, giving them a strange look.

"_Crucio, disectum_!"

Vladmir dodged both spells and locked eyes with his opponent.
He made the most of this opporunity.

"_Legilimens_!"

Kazrkern screamed in pain, eyes rolling while Vlad invaded his mind to destroy the man's thoughts as much as possible.
Too focused, he did not see the Severing Charm the mercenary managed to cast.
Fortunately his outfit absorbed the most of the attack, weak considering the mercenary's state, but it managed to break his focus.

With a gesture, he threw away his shredded cape, showing the spectators how injured he was.

The arena was covered in blood drops and a growing puddle was appearing at the mercenary's feet.
Short of breath, they stared at each other.
With a common agreement, they each eagerly drank a healing potion.

"*I did not know you were this powerful,*" Karzkern eventually said.
"*But I have to win.
You give me no choice, young Kemenov, I have to use your deepest fears...*
_Redi, hominem timor nocturnus_."

Vladmir, on his guard, frowned when nothing happened, until a figure slowly appeard in fron of him.
And he yelled.
Not in fear, which this curse aimed to do to destabalise the opponent.
He hollered in hatred and sadness.

To everyone's eyes, a young blonde girl had just appeared, covered in blood and visibly dying.
The Russians swore when they saw their protégé's reaction.
He was facing his greatest regret, his personal nightmare...

Vladmir observed the girl for a few seconds, a tortured look on his face.
Then all expression left his face, a glacial aura gushed out of him and was significantly lowering the temperature in the whole room.

"*Son of a bitch!*" Vladmir spewed out to the mercenary, pale as death.
*So you have no respect for the dead?
Natashka was your daughter's age, you bastard!*
_Millacus, Bombarda Maxima_!
*Shred!*

The young girl placed herself in the path of the spells to protect the mercenary, but the last one.
The mercenary howled in pain, and Vladmir watched as he fell to the ground, writhing in pain as his skin slowly ripped itself out.
The girl stopped moving.

"_Repulso_! 
*Freeze!* the man managed to articulate.
*Dead, protect me!*"

Although Vladmir effortlessly dodged the two spells, his opened his eyes wide when he saw Natashka throw hurl herself at him.
The child was not just an illusion, he understood in a fraction of a second.
It really was Natashka's corpse.
With a heavy heart, he cast a powerful _Repulso_ and a binding charm, before turning to the man who was observing him, in a bad shape.
He tried to raise his want, but Vlad was quicker.

"_Expeliarmus_.
*I did not think you were a necromancer, Karzkern.
But you invoqued the only person you shouldn't have.*
_Linquosanguis,_" he whispered pointing his wand on the man.

The mercenary stared at him as his wounds were bleeding increasingly quickly.
He turned to the judges who observed silently, without trying to intervene, but Karzkern knew Vladmir was in his right.
While he was conscious, the young boy could attack him all he wanted...

"*I could let you die,*" Vladmir said in a muted whisper.
*But for the sake of your wife and daughter, I agree to spare you, on one condition...*"

"*I swear on my magic to forever stay away and from Clan Kemenov,*" the mercenary said with great difficulty, right before his consciousness slipped away.

Vladmir did not hear Flitwick and Malfoy declare him as winner.
He did not see the barrier around the duelling arena lower.
He did not hear the muffled sobs of numerous students after they had witnessed all this violence.
He did not realise how silent the room was.
He did not see Katya and his Clan keep his friends from running to him.

He was imprevious to all this as he approached the girl and kneeled right besides her.
Death had taken back its prey after Karzkern had ripped it from its realm.
The flesh had started to decompose, and Natashka was still as it was in his memory, her empty orbits turned to the Great Hall enchanted ceiling.
Softly, he brushed the still intact blonde strands and pulled the corpse against him.
He put his head in her hair, and the putrid smell burned his nose and throat, but he stayed immobile.

The only noise marking Vladmir's victory were his pained howl and his sobs, as he finally grieved Natashka.
