## Chapter 22: Magical Duel

Katya walked through the council room, worried.
Sergei had just sent her a not to ask her to get to the Kemenov Palace as soo as possible.
The coded message was stamped "urgent", which was alarming in itself.

She nodded goodbye to the other two members of the Russian Triad after excusing herself.
She had to leave them alone to receive grievances from members of the Mirage Court as well as exterior sollicitations, numerous following the break-up of the former Tirad of Easter Europe.
However, Katya knew that if their opinions diverged, Xi-Mo and Anthrecna, the two Triads, would wait her return to close a case.
It was not arbitrary for the Courts to be lead by an odd number of leaders.

She pulled her hood up once she walked out of the council room door, masking her identity under the official black cape of the Mirage Court.
She kept the anonymity of members thanks to several specific spells, only showing the Court they were attached to with the coat-of-arms embroidered on the back.
Katya was wearing the symbol of the Russian branch [overlooked] by the crown with three diamonds signalling her as a Truad.
The trims of her sleeves and hood were also a symbol representing her class.
Grey as neutrality for Politicians, red as blood for Mercenaries, yellow as gold for Smugglers.

Some knew her, most ignored who their fellows were.
Only the Triads knew everyone, because you needed the unanimous approval of all three leaders to join.

Katya walked the dark hallways of the _Semirrov_ headquarters, distractedly responding to the greetings she got.
In a few minutes, she left the premices through a series of stairs through the main door.
The entrace of the _Semirrov_ headquarters used a warm, large inn on the Red Square in Moscow, ironically a few strides away from the entrance to the Russian Ministry for Magic.
The official Apparition area of the government, public toilets closed for anyone but wizards, witches or magical creatures, was also used by the Mirage Court.
Katya opened the toilets door and immediately Disappeared.

"*Katya* "
"*Hello Nikolai.
You know what is happening?* " the clan chief asked without being surprised by the presence of the vampired in the small alleyway where the wizards and witches who wanted to get to the Kemenovs' arrived.

The Vampire nodded, but refused to say anything before Katya came into their domain.
She was surprised to see Fredrich, one the Sergei's men, a efl-human mix, step out of the shadows and escort her for the hundred metres or so to the entryway of the Kemenov palace.

It was this increasingly worried that Katya came into her home and walked to her private office, where the vampired charged with the Clan safety waited for her.
The young woman slammed the door shut after Nikolai walked into the room, and she sat down behind her office, which was swarmed with piles of papers, nonchalantly throwing her cape on a chaise longue in a corner of the room.

" *Well, I repeat my question: what is happening?* " she said firmly while looking at the two vampires in front of her.

"*We have news from Vladmir.* "

"*I am suprised I did not have a message...* "

"*He sent it to Sergei directly, as he was afraid you blew up the palace before you readhis letter to the end,*" Nikolai whispered. "*There are good news, bad news...*"

"*And very bad news,*" Sergei completed.

"*Start with good news if there are very bad news, I probably won't be in any state to her the good,*" Katya admitted.
She knew her temper, and if her nephew was threatened or had grave problems, she could react very badly.
Vladmir had foresight.

"*Vlad started his mission with the support of Neville Longbottom, and does not have any particular problem."

"*Augusta and Lucius both wish for the _Underground_ to live again,*" Katya agreed.
"*I have gotten news recently, and they had good results on their side.
Licius contacted former members, and how fortunate that he had been a Triad, otherwise the whole network would have been lost...
Has Vladmir got any concrete results?*"

"*Indeed.
He has gotten his hand on an outcast of the Irish Court, Marcus O'Balley.
He sent you a copy of the magical contract binding them, and wants you to denounce him as soon as he quits or gets fired from Hogwarts.
The contract is clean, he risks nothing if you sell him to the Irish Court.*"

"*How did he find this guy?" Katya asked, surprised.
Vlad definitely had a gift to find troubles...

"*No idea.
To say the truth, his face is totally different to the one on the wanted poster, but that's logical, since they used the _Reverso Identitis_ spell.*"

"*How much is the reward?*"

"*700 Galleons,*" Nikolai smiled.

Katya nodded and asked for what was next.
Quickly, Sergei explained her how he got into the Hogwarts smuggling network.

"*He is their new supplier, and wants you to get them supplies at market price with the Clan's wholesalers.
I took the liberty to answer favourably myself.
He will send the first few orders some time this week."

"*Good... any other good news?*"

The two vampires smile contritely and looked at each other, while Katya sighed and passed a hand through her short, wild hair.
She knew she would not like what would follow.
And when Sergei started by telling her the fortunate meeting between Vlad and Narcissa Malfoy in the middle of St-Petersburg's magical quarters, she felt trouble brewing.

Actually, she should have accepted that Vlad went to Durmstrang, or even better... being homeschooled.
After all, she had the necessary tutors in the Clan...
Distractedly, lost in her thoughts, she heard two names.

"*What?*" she yelled, standing up.
"*Malfoy knows Dolohov and Darerine?*"
