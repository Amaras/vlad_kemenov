## Chapter 22: Magical Duel

Katya walked through the council room, worried.
Sergei had just sent her a not to ask her to get to the Kemenov Palace as soo as possible.
The coded message was stamped "urgent", which was alarming in itself.

She nodded goodbye to the other two members of the Russian Triad after excusing herself.
She had to leave them alone to receive grievances from members of the Mirage Court as well as exterior sollicitations, numerous following the break-up of the former Tirad of Easter Europe.
However, Katya knew that if their opinions diverged, Xi-Mo and Anthrecna, the two Triads, would wait her return to close a case.
It was not arbitrary for the Courts to be lead by an odd number of leaders.

She pulled her hood up once she walked out of the council room door, masking her identity under the official black cape of the Mirage Court.
She kept the anonymity of members thanks to several specific spells, only showing the Court they were attached to with the coat-of-arms embroidered on the back.
Katya was wearing the symbol of the Russian branch [overlooked] by the crown with three diamonds signalling her as a Truad.
The trims of her sleeves and hood were also a symbol representing her class.
Grey as neutrality for Politicians, red as blood for Mercenaries, yellow as gold for Smugglers.

Some knew her, most ignored who their fellows were.
Only the Triads knew everyone, because you needed the unanimous approval of all three leaders to join.

Katya walked the dark hallways of the _Semirrov_ headquarters, distractedly responding to the greetings she got.
In a few minutes, she left the premices through a series of stairs through the main door.
The entrace of the _Semirrov_ headquarters used a warm, large inn on the Red Square in Moscow, ironically a few strides away from the entrance to the Russian Ministry for Magic.
The official Apparition area of the government, public toilets closed for anyone but wizards, witches or magical creatures, was also used by the Mirage Court.
Katya opened the toilets door and immediately Disappeared.

"*Katya* "
"*Hello Nikolai.
You know what is happening?* " the clan chief asked without being surprised by the presence of the vampired in the small alleyway where the wizards and witches who wanted to get to the Kemenovs' arrived.

The Vampire nodded, but refused to say anything before Katya came into their domain.
She was surprised to see Fredrich, one the Sergei's men, a efl-human mix, step out of the shadows and escort her for the hundred metres or so to the entryway of the Kemenov palace.

It was this increasingly worried that Katya came into her home and walked to her private office, where the vampired charged with the Clan safety waited for her.
The young woman slammed the door shut after Nikolai walked into the room, and she sat down behind her office, which was swarmed with piles of papers, nonchalantly throwing her cape on a chaise longue in a corner of the room.

" *Well, I repeat my question: what is happening?* " she said firmly while looking at the two vampires in front of her.

"*We have news from Vladmir.* "

"*I am suprised I did not have a message...* "

"*He sent it to Sergei directly, as he was afraid you blew up the palace before you readhis letter to the end,*" Nikolai whispered. "*There are good news, bad news...*"

"*And very bad news,*" Sergei completed.

"*Start with good news if there are very bad news, I probably won't be in any state to her the good,*" Katya admitted.
She knew her temper, and if her nephew was threatened or had grave problems, she could react very badly.
Vladmir had foresight.

"*Vlad started his mission with the support of Neville Longbottom, and does not have any particular problem."

"*Augusta and Lucius both wish for the _Underground_ to live again,*" Katya agreed.
"*I have gotten news recently, and they had good results on their side.
Licius contacted former members, and how fortunate that he had been a Triad, otherwise the whole network would have been lost...
Has Vladmir got any concrete results?*"

"*Indeed.
He has gotten his hand on an outcast of the Irish Court, Marcus O'Balley.
He sent you a copy of the magical contract binding them, and wants you to denounce him as soon as he quits or gets fired from Hogwarts.
The contract is clean, he risks nothing if you sell him to the Irish Court.*"

"*How did he find this guy?" Katya asked, surprised.
Vlad definitely had a gift to find troubles...

"*No idea.
To say the truth, his face is totally different to the one on the wanted poster, but that's logical, since they used the _Reverso Identitis_ spell.*"

"*How much is the reward?*"

"*700 Galleons,*" Nikolai smiled.

Katya nodded and asked for what was next.
Quickly, Sergei explained her how he got into the Hogwarts smuggling network.

"*He is their new supplier, and wants you to get them supplies at market price with the Clan's wholesalers.
I took the liberty to answer favourably myself.
He will send the first few orders some time this week."

"*Good... any other good news?*"

The two vampires smile contritely and looked at each other, while Katya sighed and passed a hand through her short, wild hair.
She knew she would not like what would follow.
And when Sergei started by telling her the fortunate meeting between Vlad and Narcissa Malfoy in the middle of St-Petersburg's magical quarters, she felt trouble brewing.

Actually, she should have accepted that Vlad went to Durmstrang, or even better... being homeschooled.
After all, she had the necessary tutors in the Clan...
Distractedly, lost in her thoughts, she heard two names.

"*What?*" she yelled, standing up.
"*Malfoy knows Dolohov and Darerine?*"

The two vampires tried to appease her, but Katya did not listen to them at first.
Those two ere Dark Mages.
Although Lady Dolohov was gifted in Dark Magic and an extraordinary orator, able to gather crowds under her banner by her sheer presence, Darerine was even worse.
His mastery of necromancy was terrifying and he was able to materialize corpses which were decomposing for centuries and manipulate them like the genius pupetteer he was.
If Merlin's tomb was known, this man would have had the dubiously humourous idea to reaimate Merlin's corpse and pupet it...

"*Katya!*"

THe young woman observed Sergei standing in front of her.
She slowly blinked, and the objects flying around her slowly went back to their prior positions as she regained her mastery of her magic.
It had been a while since the last time she lost control like that.
THe Kemenov matriarch noticed the worried look of the two vampires and softly reassured them.

"*Well... Narcissa Malfoy has also introduced something in Hogwarts.
Apparently, it is a Dark magic artefact that probably used to belong to Voldemort.
Vlad doesn't know more about that, bu he has heard strange voices in the corridors.*"

Katya closed her eyes for a fraction of a second, then stood up quickly, jaws clenched, walking as quickly as possible to her personal chimney.

"*Wait Katya,*" sergei exclaimed while standing between her and the chimney.
He knew exactly what his clan chief wanted to do.
"*Lucius Malfoy doesn't know.*"

"You're kidding, right?*" Katya growled.
"*Narcissa is his wife under the ancient laws!*"

"He. knows. nothing.*" Sergei slowly articulated.
"*The House elf assured Vlad that its mistress was the only one implicated.*"

Katya did not put two and two together at first.
The House Elf... It was probably Dobby...
So he was linked to House Malfoy, and Vlad probably used the young Draco's status as heir in order to get information, bypassing Narcissa's orders.
In that case, she had to talk to Lucius quickly.

Katya observed Sergei for a bit, before nodding and sitting back at her desk, a sure sing that she was in a bad mood, and she fet it was only the beginning.

"*Wait, you said Vlad heard voices?*" she whispered as the information was processed by her mind once it was slightly clear from the fog of anger.

Nikolai noded, and she sighed while rubbing her forehead.
This kid knew how to drive her crazy...

"*Annyway*," she continued.
"*How many bad news like that remain?"

Sergei slowly breathed in and locked gaze with Katya.
The young woman felt a tinge in her stomach.
He only used the vampiric soul eyes to announce the worst news.

"*Karzkern challenged Vladmir in the name of the Fedovir clan, using the ancient imperial duelling laws.*"

Katya exploded.

Half the furniture of her office were shattered.
Glass fragments scattered in the room, injuring the to vampired despite the woman's instinctive magic's protection.
A glacial wind rose up, as everything fle arounf her.
Katya vaguely heard cries in the palace, her people probably alerted by the discharge of raw magic.
But she could only think of one thing.

Karzkern had challenged her nephew, her kitten...
One of the harshest mercenaries in Russia had challenged the heir to Clan Kemenov.

A man with 30 yers of duelling and Dark Magic experience had challenged a 12 year-old by, still learning, following the imperial rules.

And Vladmir, as heir, could not refuse this duel.

A public duel, only prohibiting direct death curses.
A no holds barred duel, where all kinds of magic were allowed.

Vladmir risked death for the honour of a despisable clan who could not sustain a war.
Katya trusted her nephew and his magical ability, but she was afraid.
Afraid he would be graveluy injured, or worse...

When she got her attention back on Sergei, the vampire could not hold back an uneasy shiver.
Katya had put on her war mask, and when her voice rose up, his oath of alliegeance made him kneel before her, as did Nikolai, and the ten or so people who looked in from outside the office.

"*I, Katya Anapovna Kemenov, swear on my magic that I will destroy Clan Fedovir if Vlad dies during this duel,*" Katya said, her voice filled with power from the grave, her eyes glowing with hatred.

All trembled, however could do but accept the Vow.
The members of Clan Kmenow -- man, woman, child, soldier, or mere servant - felt deep within their magic that their leader has started a clan war.

Then Katya turned her gaze towards the small group outside the door and made them flee with a simple look.
The Dark magical aura shining around her was terrifying, and she got her attention back towards the two till kneeling vampires.

"*When?*"

"*Tomorrow morning, in Hogwarts' Great Hall.
Vladmir, following the rules, chose the judges.
He chose Goblin Master Filius Flitwick and Lucius Malfoy.*"

"*Good.
Nokolai, summon Fredrich and Borislav.
You have one hour.
Have them ready for combat."

The vampired immediately disappeared to carry out the order.
In one hour, the soldiers would be present and ready to go to war.
Katya observed her destroyed office with a detached eye, then motioned for Sergei to follow her.

The campired obeyed and followed her to her appartments.
He saw her disappear for a few minutes in her bedromm, and Katya walked out with her combat cape, armed to the teeth.
A few seconds afterwards, they entered Vladmir's domain, more precisely his dressing room, where his niece opened an isolated wardrobe.
He carefully took the outfit on which the unique belt laid, as well as the impeccably folded combat robes.
In one felt swoop, she put the robes made out of accromentula silk and protections made out od dragon leather in a bag, before taking the suspended satchel, then the stylets and daggers that Sergei had grown accustomed to during his training sessions with Vlad.

---

Thirty minutes later, Katya was standing in the entry hall of the palace, the three dozen other inhabitants silently standing behind her and her suite.
Children stayed hiddden behind their mothers skirts, scared by Katya's aura, as she had always been warm to them before, as well as the adults' serious faces.

"*Lady Kemenov...*"

Katya turned an expressionless face to the new Kemenov stewardess, as the previous one dies of her wounds during the last Clan war.

"*Please transmit our support to Vladmir Vassilievitch.
We all root for him.
He is a strong and powerful young man, noble and just.
He deserves to win, and we would stand behind him if allowed to.
Tell him we will wait for him this winter with a somptuous meal celebrating his victory.*"

Katya unnoticeably nodded, as all strongly supported the young stewardess.
She would transmit this memory to Vladmir a few hours before his duel to mentally support him.
The matriarch knew how important the support of the Clan was to Vladmir's spirit and will to live.
The whole Clan was behind him, believing in his victory.
He could not help but win to thank them for their confidence.

The door flew open, showing Fredrich, Nikolai, and a third immensly tall and powerfull-built man, with long, pure-white hair in a loose plait.
Like Katya, both humans wore combat outfits.

"*Good, let's go!*"

Katya waved at her Clan, delegating her leadership to Andrei, the fourth person in the clan's hierarchy, right after Sergei, giving him a message to transmit to the Mirage Court, announcing that the problems were serious enough to warrant her unforeseen absence.
Then, getting to the dark alley behind the palace, the group Disappeared towards the St-Ptersburg ministry.

---

"*I don't care about the price,*" Katya declared with a glacial voice to the employee charged with international transports, who seemed tired.
"*I demand an international Portkey to Hogsmead, Scotland, for five passengers.*"

"*But Lady Kemenov...*"

"*Enough!
Bring me to the department's manager!*" Katya thundered, exasperated after ten minutes of useless discussions, sending a cold wave on the employees around her, all of whom shivered uneasily.
Whispers could be heard behind them, and the Kemenov matriarch turned to the three employees peeked from the corridor.
She looked daggers at them, threatening, then her eyes caught sight of a silver plaque stamped with the international symbol of magical transports behind them.

Without any word, she walked away from the front desk and towards the door, followed by her four followers who seemed rather indimidating in their combat uniform embroidered with Kemenov coat-of-arms.
The three employees yelped and hid against the walls to let them through.

"*Wait, you can't got there!*"

Katya ignored the panicked voice of the employee, and knocked sharply at the door stamped "Ivan Verskovski, Director of the Department of International Transports, Federal District of Saint-Petersburg."

"*Come in!*" a voice muffled by the door rang.

Katya opened the door, and sa a man she knew well, as she had met him in several evening receptions and balls of the Russian high society.
On seeing her, Verkovski stood up and walked around his desk with a smile on his face, then put his hands on the young woman's shoulder to kis both her cheeks.

"*Katya Annapovna!*"

"*Ivan Afonovitch.*"

"*Sir, I'm deeply sorry, this woman...*"

The Director turned to see his employee try to pass by Katya's men and frowned.

"*This woman is the matriarch of Clan Kemenov.
I know her well and she can disturb me whenever she likes, Nanosko.*"
