## Chapter 19: A hectic start of school year

**"Freeze!"** Vlad yelled as he woke up with a start.

Something was in his room.
Something living and magical...
He had let his instincts cast the spell without conscious thought.
His eyes shone with mistrust, and he asked the Kemenov palace for some light as he slowly got up.
The ancestral home had its own will, developped from the magical radiations of the numerous generations of wizards and witches in his family.
Once the room was lit up, Vladmir observed his quarters with caution.
There, in the middle of the big bedroom with pastel wall, lying on the Persian carpet decorated with the Kemenov and Potter coats-of-arms, a ouse elf was immobilised.

Vladmir gritted his teeth, and prepared without any emotion a brutal sleeping spell on the frozen creature, while Sasha, was hissing threateningly on its skinny torso.

"_No, Sasssha, leave thissss elf alone_", Vladmir hissed.

He pointed his wand on the small creature, whose bulging eyes were rolling in terror.
Vladmir knew that he looked terrifying when he had just woke up, especially with a start and angry.
His eyes were nearly glowing with fury as his face was glacial.

**"Stun,"** he groaned. "_Sassha, please watch him_"

After his viper agreed and without even looking at the unconscious elf, he caught a black shirt nearby and got it over his grey silck night trousers.
He did not take the time to button his shirt and briskly walked out of his room, wand in hand.

He walked through the small drawing room in his quarters and crossed the hallway in the family aisle of the Kemenov palace.
Without knoking, he enteres his aunt's domain, finding her unsurprisingly awake at 3 o'clock in the morning.
Sometimes being insomniac was a good thing.

**"Kitten?"** Katya asked, looking up from her book.

**"I have a house elf in my room."**

Katya rose up, not asking any more question.
If Vlad had come to see her, it was because the elf was unknown and did not bear any coat-of-arms on his clothes.
Every house elf that was attached t a wizarding family bore the insigna of his House.
There were not many reasons why a servant did not wear the family livery.
Either a sneak attack, or the servant was disobeying.
In either case, it was not a good thing.

She followed her nephew to his appartments and looked at the small unconscious being with a grimace.
Sasha, on Vlad's order, calmly rolled around her friend's neck.

The elf, wearing what seemed like an old pillowcase, had a suspicious smell and signs of abuse.
His clayey skin was dull, which was one of the most distinctive symptoms in house elves.
His ears being floppy were anither one.
A healthy elf had a shiny skin and ears perked up on its head, often wearing bone jewelry that were typically elfic that proved their attechment to their family and they place in the house hierarchy.

With an unspoken spell, the creature was bound and brought to the basements of the Kemenov palace.
Several specific rooms had been created to be particularly efficient dungeons.
Complex spells had been cast on them.
No magic was possible, except when used by the members of the Kemenov family, meaning Vlad, Katya, and Sergei.

The matriarch closed the door and woke up the small being, who fluttered its eyes, its huge and floppy ears were trembling as well.
Then it seemed to become aware of its situation.
It was lying on a table, the only furniture in the grey and sad room, under the cross fire of two frightening pairs of eyes.
The dark irises of Katya were empty, as if no soul existed behind the facade, while Vlad's eyes were as cold as the Russian winter, shining with mistrust, a menacing snake slithering around its neck as if to protect him.

"Well," Katya whispered. "Do you know who I am?"

The elf wanted to speak, but no sound got out of its mouth, its eyes widening in panic.

**"Vlad, get your mutism spell off."**

Vladmir groaned, but he obeyed his aunt, waiving his hand carelessly.

"Dobby did not want this," the elf said with its high and fearful voice. "Dobby wanted to meet the great Harry POtter!"

This time, the Vlad seemed furious at the creature, and the house elf cowered as best it could, despite the ties that bound it.

"Dobby apologises for angering Sir Harry Potter," Dobby said.
"Bad Dobby, bad."

Katya observed the House elf injure itself by hitting its head on the stainless steel table for a few seconds, the sound bouncing back and forth inside the room gloomily.
She eventually cast a pillowing spell on the surface.

"What is the purpose of your presence?" Katya asked slowly.

"Dobby... Dobby has comme to tell you... Dobby has comme to warn Harry Potter..."

Vladmir's expression upon hearing that name was too much for the small creature which sobbed uncontrollably, but the boy did not care about it.
As long as he did not know what the House elf wanted, he would not have any compassion for it.
Especially since it wanted to talk with Harry Potter -- the icon -- and not himself, Vlad Kemenov.
He loved his parents...
But he hated his birth name that had been glorified horribly for politics and wizarding commerce.

Both Kemenovs listened to the elf crying without showing any feeling for several long minutes.
Then Vladmir, understanding that it would not stop soon, approached the elf.
Dobby swallowed when he saw the boy leaning towards it, its big grey globulous eyes locking into the hypnotic green gaze.

"You're going to tell me what you were doing in my room in the middle of the night", he whispered.
You're also going to tell me how you managed to get through the palace's defences and which family you belong to."

The elf's eyes widened in panic at the last demand, and it tried to get out of reach.

"**Vlad, let me talk to it, it's terrorised**", Katya said, approching the elf herself.

Vladmir could be particularly scary when he was crossed and tired.
To be woken up in the middle of the night, without any coffee, by some stranger with dubious intentions, right in what her nephew considered his sanctuary...
Of course, he was in a foul mood.
Katya leaned over the House elf and observed it, noticing once again traces of abuse on the creature's olive-ish skin.

"Why did you want to see Harry?" she asked softly.

"Dobby... Harry Potter must not go back to Hogwarts," the House elf chocked at the sudden kidness he sensed in the Kemenov matriarch's voice.

"Why?"

"He will be in grave danger"

"Why?" Katya asked again calmly, eying her nephew who moved to the house elf's blindspot to avoid worsening Dobby's mood.

"Terrifying events," Dobby murmurred, tremors going through his whole body.
"Harry Potter is precious.
Harry Potter must not put his life in peril!"

"What events?" Vladmir asked.

Dobby wriggled, trying to see Vlad, who stepped into the magical creature's field of view.

"Provoked by whom?"

Dobby groaned, terrified, and suddenly got out of Katya's grasp.
It fell to the ground before the Kemenovs could react, and started hitting its forehead on the stone slabs on the ground.
At the second hit, greyish blood flowed.

"Bad Dobby... The Masters..."

Katya wrenched it from the floor by its clothes and cast a spell on it to literally glue it on the metal table.
She then crudely healed it, and the wound on its forehead stopped bleeding.

"**Its masters are linked to Hogwarts' future problems,**" Vladmir groaned.

"**I'm thinking the same thing,**" Katya nodded, looking at her nephew.
His anger was tangible.
His trouble happened, Vlad would make it a priority to protect his friends.

"What events?" Vladmir repeated.

"Dobby... can't...
Dobby is under a contract...
Dobby wanted to warn Harry Potter...
The great Harry Potter must not go back to Hogwarts.
The bad magic... It..."

Vlad and Katya exchanged a dark look as the small elf sobbed again.
They would not get anything more out of it.
As with all the members of its race linked to a wizarding House or family, he had to keep its masters' secrets."

"How do you enter the palace?" Vladmir asked slowly.

"Debby..." the small creature squealed.

Katya forwned when she heard the name of the young Kemenov House elf.
Through the tears of the creature, the two Russians understood that they shared blood, as they were probably cousins, and that their magical signature were nearly identical.
Dobby was able to get inside without any constraint.

They left the room several hours later, sending Dobby back to its masters, but only after casting a few constraining charms on it.
Vlad had had a twinge of sadness when he saw that the elf seemed shocked that he used Dark Magic, but he held his and his clan's safety as a priority.
The creature could never tell of his link with Debby nor his ability to infiltrate the Kemenov palace with impunity.

The sky was getting lighter when Vladmir got to his room and he sprawled on his bed, muttering.
he was still sore from the Summer Race, and he had to get to the Kappa Quay to buy the last of his school supplies.

"_You should not get back on the bed_", Sasha hissed softly while curling up on his collarbone.
"_You will sleep again_..."

Vlad made a scornful sound, but he listened to the small viper and got up, before disappearing for a fraction of a second into his walk-in wardrobe.
He got back impeccably dressed with dark but refined clothes, made with a dark green fabric.
His hair was left free for once and cascaded over his shoulders, only the strands falling over his eyes were held back by a silver clip.
Tradition was that the heirs of great lines of wizards left their hair loose when they went out...

Vlad held out his hand and Sasha curled up around his wrist, transforming to look like a sliver bracelet.
Thus Vladmir went back to the blue drawing room, one of the familial rooms, which were forbidden to all but the last remaining members of the Kemenov family.

The Easter wing was Katya's and Vlad's, as well as their personal guests.
Nobody was allowed in without express permission from a Kemenov.
As huge as it was, the familial palace needed the room with its no less than 40 inhabitants.
It stretched 6 floors and three wings surrounding a central space, and housed a few families affiliated with the clan, as well as guards and servants.
They all resided in the southern wing, while the northern wing was used for the clan's business.
The centrall hall was the reception spot; the ball room, reception rooms and library were located there.

Katya was already present in the blue drawing room, reading a journal, a cup of black tea next to her. 
Vlad took a newspaper from the thick pile that occupied half of the small table and sat in front of his aunt.

"**Tea, Kitty?**", the matriarch asked without stopping her reading of an article of the _Red Dawn_, the Russian wizarding newspaper.

"**Yes, please,**," Vlad answered while absent-mindedly reading over the headlines of the _Daily Prophet_.

_Inauguration of the New Department of Wizarding Education_

_Of the Importance of the Education of Young Witches and Wizards_

_Gilderoy Lockhart Signing Session at Flourish and Blotts_

"**Amelia Bones has sent you an invitation**"

"**What does the Chief Warlock of the Wizengamot want with me?**" Vlad asked, surprised, without stopping his reading.
He took no offence at his aunt being in the know.
The head of the Department of Magical Law Enforcement had probably followed the Russian Wizarding etiquette, talking to the matriarch before contacting her heir.

"**No idea.
She wants to meet you during the winter holidays.**"

"**I will accept when she contacts me,**" Vlad nodded.

The two Kemenovs fell silent, absorbed by their readings.
The young boy quickly read the headlines of _The Quibbler_, an English weekly publication; _La Voix de la République_, a French periodical; and _The Sorcerer Times_, directly imported from the United States, before he finished his cup of tea.

"**Abkhazia declared its independance yesterday,**" Katya declared while sipping on her own beverage.

Vladmir frowned.

"**The Wizarding part or the Muggle part?**"

Legitimate question when numerous provices of the former USSR regularly declared their independence and formed new republics.

"**Muggle.
However, according to my sources, the new leader is under an English coersion spell.
The** _imperium_ **I think.**"

"**What are the English interests in appropriating this part?**"

"**Numerous deposits of Celestial Opals.**"

Vladmir thought for a few seconds and grimaced.

"**Death Eaters?**" he worried.

It was obvious that the English Ministry for Magical was too incompetent in its current form to disersify its geopolitical control in other countries.
Only powerful groups that were completely detached from the law could manage to use forbidded spells like the _imperium_.
Vlad only knew two of those groups: the Death Eater movement, and the Order of the Phoenix.

"**No.
The same sources told me that it was linked to the Malfoy name, though.**"

Vladmir closed his eyes while leaning back onto his seat.
Malfoy.
Lucius indeed had links to illegal networks.

"**I thought the Underground was gone,**" he whispered while remembering Neville's words at the beginning of their first year.
'_It's complicated_', he had said about the British branch of the Mirage Court.

"**Officially it is,**" Katya declared.
"**Two of the triads are dead and have never been replaced.
Lucius Malfoy is the only survivor, and he prefered destroying the British branch from the inside.
He acted when Voldemort was active, rather than putting it under the control of the dark mage like he would have wanted.**"

"**So Malfoy Sr...**"

"**Voldemort never know what role Lucius had.
As one of the three Triads, he did what he could to prevent him from seizing the British networks.**"

"**Draco doesn't know.**"

Vladmir was certain of it.
Draco probably didn't have the faintest idea of the real political and economic weight of his father.
If Lucius Malfoy was the last of the ruling trio of the British mafia, he had more contacts than any simply Lord, were he Undersecretary of International Magical Cooperation and Death Eater.

"**Who were the other two Triads?**" Vladmir asked with genuine curiosity.
"**Maybe the Longbottoms...**"

"**No, the other two Triads were Orion Black and Julius O'Summers.
But you're not far off.
Franck Longbottom was, as his mother before him, one of the best assassins of the Underground.
I suspect Augusta is teaching her grandsone the ropes of being a hitman,**" she smiled.

Vladmir smiled himself, amused.
Indeed, Neville had all the abilities to be a good assassin.
His cover had already been created and it was brilliant.
He should speak with him about it when the school year started...
And with Draco...

His mind still thinking about it, Vladmir finished his preparation to buy the last remaining school supplies.
He already had virtually everything, with the exception of a series of book for the Defence Against the Dark Arts course, as well as a few potions ingredients.
Vladmir used the Floo network to get to _The Purple Mage_, one of the most popular bars on the Tsar Plaza.
His arrival went unnoticed due to the usual agitation in the tavern, and he squeezed through the crowd to get out.

The gloomy weather meant that fewer people that usual were out, and Vladmir pulled up the hood of his cape to protect himself from the persitent drizzle, as well as mask his face.
He hoped that his favourite bookshop managed to order the books he needed.

He followed the small river and walked up the alleys until he reached the calmer and darker neighbourhoods of the wizarding city.
Under his cape, Vlad was not standing out from the other passers-by, and he quickly noticed the dimly lit front of _Words of Power_.
The shop front was narrow, but in reality hid a huge library, and the entry bell rang clearly.
The inside was totally different from what could be guessed from the exterior.
The numerous shelves was perfectly clean, books and grimoires meticulously organised.
Vladmir quickly went up the the Muggle section and easily found the last international treaties, before going to the Muggle litterature section.
Katya asked him to get one of the original editions of the _Dell'arte della guerra_ essay from Machiavel that she had spotted in the shop.
He also stopped in the rare grimoire section, and after a long hestitation, got a copy of the uncorrected first edition of _Blood Runes_.

With the multiple books in hand, he walked to the counter and saw a thin woman with long, blonde hair, who was walking out of the shop.
He frowned and observed her silhouette.
He had already seen this woman...

"**Mister Kemenov!**" a young, smiling woman sudden exclaimed.

Vladmit saw that the unknown woman tensed up when she heard his name and hurriedly pulled up her hood further before exiting the shop.
Thoughtful, Vlad turned back to face the owner of _Words of Power_.
Her long, blond hair and pale skin was fascinating, and he knew perfectly not the stare into her purple eyes unless he wanted to be ensnared.
After all, appearance wasn't everything, and you should be weary of centuries-old succubusses.

"**Miss Jealing,**" Vladmir smiled as he bowed to her, "**did you receive my order?**"

"**Of course, young man,**" Athena Jealing answered, before wrinkling her nose in disgust. "**Are you sure you want this rubbish?**"

Vladmir grimaced slightly and nodded.

"**Unfortunately, the author is my future Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher.**"


The succubus snorted mockingly and took Vladmir's order and put it upon the already substential pile.
She flicked her wand and the price glowed abov the books.
Vlad took a fine purse bearing the Gringott's logo.

"**Do you know the nme of the woman who just got out?**" Vladmir asked calmly as he put down several Galleons more than the asking price.

The succubus plunged her purple gaze in Vlad's emerald one, as he raised his Occlumency barriers to the highest level possible to protect himself from the magical creature's attraction.
He thus held the succubus's gaze and gave a cold smile when Jeaning extended her hand towards the gold.

He put his palm over the Galleons to prevent her from getting them, and raised an eyebrowquestioningly.
A tongue that was far too long to be human ran greedily over her lips.

"**The English aristocracy sometimes come to seek occult tomes,**" Jealing whispered.

Vladmir took back several coins from the stack.

"**The** _old_ **aristocracy...**"

The young Kemenov carelessly put several Galleons back into his purse, voluntarily letting the succubus catch glimpses of the golden shine.
Cupidity was glowing harder in the magical creature's amethyst eyes.

"**The servents if the snake lord are not many, Kemenov,**" whispered.
"**The woman filled the silver cup with venom.
Dark magic enslaves the husband as surely as does his own shame.**"

Vladmir kept immobile for a few seconds as his perfectly ordered mind was looking for clues in the mysterious sentence.
A blonde Death Eater who was the wife of Pure-Blood family patriarch...
A patriarch with the Dark Mark who was not in prison...
A man that is against Voldemort but can't affirm it...
A silver cup...
Vlad frowned, suddenly worried.
One family had a coat-of-arms with a white cup on a dark field.
One family that was suspected to be Death Eaters but was still free, and whose patriarch he knew had the Mark.
A family whose matriarch was a blonde as the rest of her family...
Malfoys.

He gave Athena Jealing a correct amount and a smile, before shrinking the books and making them disappear in his cape's pocket.

He left _Words of Power_ and got his wand out of his wrist holster.
Vladmir hesitated for a few seconds, then he slashed his forearm bofore articulating some hoarse words.
A trickle of Dark magic sprang from whis and connected to his splilled bood, and transformed into a small, foggy, opaque sphere that seemed to absorb light.

"**Target: Narcissa Malfoy née Black, if present in Saint-Peterberg,**" Vlad whispered.
The mist turned around and changed colours, becoming a silvery grey.

"_You should tell Katya_," Shasha said, springing from his neck as the sphere was shivering, waiting for the last order to follow its target.
Narcissa Malfoy was still in town, otherwise the sphere would not have changed colours.
Vladmir hesitated, then nodded and invoked a magical note that he charmed to transmit the information to Katya.

"**Fetch!**" he finally told the sphere, slashing his arm again, splashing drops of blood on the mist.
It shivered again, then started to move, slowly at first, then increasingly faster, as Vladmir followed suit.
He had just reach the Tsar Plaza when the sphere froze and became black again.

Vlad bumped into a mother when he suddenly stopped, swearing out of spite.
He attracted unfriendly glances from the small family, the mother and her daughter, as well as a few passers-by.
Nobody asked what he was doing when he dismissed his black magical sphere, however.

"**Please excuse me,**" Vladmir finally said, turning to the mother who was kneeling on the cobblestones.
He noted the spilled fruits on the ground and kneeled as well to help her pick up the basket.
She gave him a reproachful look.

"**You have to be careful, son,**" she said as a small girl clung to her long skirt.
Vladmir felt a pang in his heart when he saw the small, round face staring at him, worry in her big, blue eyes.
The Russian woman, realising the young wizard was staring back at her daughter, observed his expressionless face.
The boy was very pale.
She then saw the coat-of-arms embroidered on the cape, and that made her jump, several fruits falling back on the ground.
She gave him a saddened smile and slightly bowed her head.

"**I am deeply sorry for your loss, heir Kemenov.
The clan war that affected your family must have been terrible.**"

She suspected why the young boy's eyes were visibly filled with sadness.
The first ones to die were the children.
Despite their instinctual magic, they were too weak to protect themselves, and the articles that came out after the attack on Clan Kemenov had told about a dozen dead children.
She remembered seeing a photo that had made an impression on her.
One showing a small girl smiling, one who looked somewhat like here daugter...

Vladmir smiled back, still pale.

"**Thank you...**"

"**Navrina Felovna Dezovski.**"

Vlamdir frowned when he heard the name of one of the main "light" families in Russia.
If he remembered correctly, Navrina was the third and last daughter of 12 siblings, and her marriage to a firbolg had stirred controversy.

Vladmir's gaze became colder when he thought about her hasband.

"**Excuse my curiosity, but why didn't you take the Karzkern name?
You are married, aren't you?**"

The young Russian woman smiled, not yet realising that Vladmir became a menacing presence.

"**My wife is stubborn, heir Kemenov,**" the newcommer said with a deep voice.
Vladmir and Navrina stood back at the same time when a tall man with a pronounced beard walked towards her.
The girl then left her mother's skirt to run directly in his arms.

Vlamdir observed the man, whose simian features were now evident as he stood in front of him.
The black gems incrusted into his skin were indicative of a high-ranking warrior.

"**Warrior Karzkern,**" he greeted him with a glacial voice, his face frozen in a sombre expression.

"**Greetings, Heir Kemenov.
I did not think I would be able to meet you some day.
Lady Kemenov is very protective of you.**"

Vladmir had a cold simle when he saw Karzkern imperceptibly pivot to protect his daughter from an unexpected attack.
If Katya never allowed him to meet the man, it was because the firborg belonged to the Fedovir clan, an clan that was vying for a spot as a Mirage Court Triad.
This automatically made him an enemy of his family...
And what a shame he met him in the middle of a plaza and not in a dark alley, because Vladmir would have evicerated him if he could.
Clan Fedovir was suspected of supporting the Goererine during the clan war.

"**Hello Karz.**"

Nikolai had just suddenly appeared behind Vlad, placing a protecting hand on his shoulder.

The firborg recoiled from the vampire and gave his daughter back to Navrina, before asking them to wait for him in the closest tavern.
At the same time, Sergei and a third member of the Kemenov clan appeared behind them.
Navrina immediately took her daughter into her arms and placed herself behind her husband, worry perfectly visible on her delicate face.

Vladmir observed the man for a few seconds, then shook his head.

"**Leave him, it's niether the place, nor the time,**" he whispered, pointing to two aurors who were splitting the crows towards them.

"**Remember one thing, Karzken,**" Fredrich, the third clan member, declared coldly, "**If we have any proof that you or your clan was involved in this winter's clan war, it will be eye for eye, tooth for totth.**"

The look that the Kemenov clan member gave the firborg's daughter were explicit enough, and the young Russian woman was shaking, pressing her daughter against her.

"**Is everything alright, Ma'am?**" an auror asked, placing himself between the two parties.

"**Yes, officer,**" Navrina Dezovska said with a trembling voice.

"**Please move along then,**" the second wizard replied, his hand on his sabre.

---

Vladmir was still ruminating this encounter the day after, leaning on a pillar next to the entryway of platform 9 3/4 of King's Cross station.
Sergei was quietly sitting on a bench, and Katya could not make it, as she had an important meeting of the Mirage Court.

"Vlad, Sergei!", Kevin's cheery voice exclaimed.

"Hey boys!"

"Hello everyone!"

Vladmir smiled when his saw Kevin, Hermione, and Neville appear one after the other, each accompanied by their parents.
Presumably, the two Muggle couples had already met each other before, as they were chatting amicably with Augusta Longbottom a little further.
Sergei stood up to join them, while the friends affectionately greeted each other.

"In any case, you were lucky," Neville exclaimed, observing Kevin and Hermione.
"There are problems with the entryway.
It's apparently stuck!"

They all turned their gaze to the entryway.
A family of redheads was wailing just outside the door, visibly seperated from some of their children.

"Just how many brothers Ron has?" Kevin asked, surprised.

"They are seven, if I remember correctly.
William is the eldesr, and this is Ginerva's -- the youngest -- first year at Hogwarts."

"Out of seven, the two oldest are interesting, as are the twins," Vlad noted with a smile.
"I know neither Percy nor Giverva, however."

"They have... peculiar names," Kevin whispered.

"I'd say magical," Hermione responded with a laugh.
"Charlie is not very original, though."

"William, Charles, Percy, Fred, George, Ronald, and Ginerva," Neville declared.

"I understand the nicknames," Kevin continued.

"Do you think Draco is stuck as well?" Vladmir asked while observing the Weasley matriarch railing against a station employer, while her husband, a visibly tired balding man, was trying to calm her down.

"I think.
The Floo network is disrupted as well," Neville nodded.

Vladmir grumbled, annoyed.
He would have to wait to ask him the questions he wanted answers to.
The Hogwarts-Express was thus pretty empty, and the trip went relatively smoothly, despit some pranks organised by two Gryffindors in the Slytherin compartments.

Their arrival in Hogsmead was calm as well, and they smiled when they saw that the students who had missed the train were waiting for them on the station.
They greeted Draco, who was chatting with Daphne, Blaise, and Theo, from afar before following the rest of the students.

"Do you think that each year we'll get a new way to get to Hogwarts?" Kevin asked while observing the station plaza.
"After the rowboats last year, what now?
A dragon?"

"Thestrals," Vlad answered, looking at the first carriages coming into view.

"Thes-what?" Hermione asked, eyes full of curiosity.

"Thestrals," Neville repeated, looking at the creatures as well.

"There's nothing here," Kevin declared.
"Only magical carriages."

Vladmir raised an eyebrow and smiled.
He walked up to pet the closest creature, and stroked the dark horse's bony hide.

"I hope that you never see them," a young ginger girl wearing the Hufflepuff crest intervened.
"Because that would mean that you had seen death."

"Susan," Neville timidly greeted her.

Vladmir, disctractedly stroking the thestral, carefully observed his friend, frowning.
Why in Merlin's name did Neville seemed _really_ uneasy with the Hufflepuff?
And above all... why was this girl he did not know was looking at him with... _anxiety_?
