## Chapter 19: A hectic start of school year

**"Freeze!"** Vlad yelled as he woke up with a start.

Something was in his room.
Something living and magical...
He had let his instincts cast the spell without conscious thought.
His eyes shone with mistrust, and he asked the Kemenov palace for some light as he slowly got up.
The ancestral home had its own will, developped from the magical radiations of the numerous generations of wizards and witches in his family.
Once the room was lit up, Vladmir observed his quarters with caution.
There, in the middle of the big bedroom with pastel wall, lying on the Persian carpet decorated with the Kemenov and Potter coats-of-arms, a ouse elf was immobilised.

Vladmir gritted his teeth, and prepared without any emotion a brutal sleeping spell on the frozen creature, while Sasha, was hissing threateningly on its skinny torso.

"_No, Sasssha, leave thissss elf alone_", Vladmir hissed.

He pointed his wand on the small creature, whose bulging eyes were rolling in terror.
Vladmir knew that he looked terrifying when he had just woke up, especially with a start and angry.
His eyes were nearly glowing with fury as his face was glacial.

**"Stun,"** he groaned. "_Sassha, please watch him_"

After his viper agreed and without even looking at the unconscious elf, he caught a black shirt nearby and got it over his grey silck night trousers.
He did not take the time to button his shirt and briskly walked out of his room, wand in hand.

He walked through the small drawing room in his quarters and crossed the hallway in the family aisle of the Kemenov palace.
Without knoking, he enteres his aunt's domain, finding her unsurprisingly awake at 3 o'clock in the morning.
Sometimes being insomniac was a good thing.

**"Kitten?"** Katya asked, looking up from her book.

**"I have a house elf in my room."**

Katya rose up, not asking any more question.
If Vlad had come to see her, it was because the elf was unknown and did not bear any coat-of-arms on his clothes.
Every house elf that was attached t a wizarding family bore the insigna of his House.
There were not many reasons why a servant did not wear the family livery.
Either a sneak attack, or the servant was disobeying.
In either case, it was not a good thing.

She followed her nephew to his appartments and looked at the small unconscious being with a grimace.
Sasha, on Vlad's order, calmly rolled around her friend's neck.

The elf, wearing what seemed like an old pillowcase, had a suspicious smell and signs of abuse.
His clayey skin was dull, which was one of the most distinctive symptoms in house elves.
His ears being floppy were anither one.
A healthy elf had a shiny skin and ears perked up on its head, often wearing bone jewelry that were typically elfic that proved their attechment to their family and they place in the house hierarchy.

With an unspoken spell, the creature was bound and brought to the basements of the Kemenov palace.
Several specific rooms had been created to be particularly efficient dungeons.
Complex spells had been cast on them.
No magic was possible, except when used by the members of the Kemenov family, meaning Vlad, Katya, and Sergei.

The matriarch closed the door and woke up the small being, who fluttered its eyes, its huge and floppy ears were trembling as well.
Then it seemed to become aware of its situation.
It was lying on a table, the only furniture in the grey and sad room, under the cross fire of two frightening pairs of eyes.
The dark irises of Katya were empty, as if no soul existed behind the facade, while Vlad's eyes were as cold as the Russian winter, shining with mistrust, a menacing snake slithering around its neck as if to protect him.

"Well," Katya whispered. "Do you know who I am?"

The elf wanted to speak, but no sound got out of its mouth, its eyes widening in panic.

**"Vlad, get your mutism spell off."**

Vladmir groaned, but he obeyed his aunt, waiving his hand carelessly.

"Dobby did not want this," the elf said with its high and fearful voice. "Dobby wanted to meet the great Harry POtter!"

This time, the Vlad seemed furious at the creature, and the house elf cowered as best it could, despite the ties that bound it.

"Dobby apologises for angering Sir Harry Potter," Dobby said.
"Bad Dobby, bad."

Katya observed the House elf injure itself by hitting its head on the stainless steel table for a few seconds, the sound bouncing back and forth inside the room gloomily.
She eventually cast a pillowing spell on the surface.

"What is the purpose of your presence?" Katya asked slowly.

"Dobby... Dobby has comme to tell you... Dobby has comme to warn Harry Potter..."

Vladmir's expression upon hearing that name was too much for the small creature which sobbed uncontrollably, but the boy did not care about it.
As long as he did not know what the House elf wanted, he would not have any compassion for it.
Especially since it wanted to talk with Harry Potter -- the icon -- and not himself, Vlad Kemenov.
He loved his parents...
But he hated his birth name that had been glorified horribly for politics and wizarding commerce.

Both Kemenovs listened to the elf crying without showing any feeling for several long minutes.
Then Vladmir, understanding that it would not stop soon, approached the elf.
Dobby swallowed when he saw the boy leaning towards it, its big grey globulous eyes locking into the hypnotic green gaze.

"You're going to tell me what you were doing in my room in the middle of the night", he whispered.
You're also going to tell me how you managed to get through the palace's defences and which family you belong to."

The elf's eyes widened in panic at the last demand, and it tried to get out of reach.

"**Vlad, let me talk to it, it's terrorised**", Katya said, approching the elf herself.

Vladmir could be particularly scary when he was crossed and tired.
To be woken up in the middle of the night, without any coffee, by some stranger with dubious intentions, right in what her nephew considered his sanctuary...
Of course, he was in a foul mood.
Katya leaned over the House elf and observed it, noticing once again traces of abuse on the creature's olive-ish skin.

"Why did you want to see Harry?" she asked softly.

"Dobby... Harry Potter must not go back to Hogwarts," the House elf chocked at the sudden kidness he sensed in the Kemenov matriarch's voice.

"Why?"

"He will be in grave danger"

"Why?" Katya asked again calmly, eying her nephew who moved to the house elf's blindspot to avoid worsening Dobby's mood.

"Terrifying events," Dobby murmurred, tremors going through his whole body.
"Harry Potter is precious.
Harry Potter must not put his life in peril!"

"What events?" Vladmir asked.

Dobby wriggled, trying to see Vlad, who stepped into the magical creature's field of view.

"Provoked by whom?"

Dobby groaned, terrified, and suddenly got out of Katya's grasp.
It fell to the ground before the Kemenovs could react, and started hitting its forehead on the stone slabs on the ground.
At the second hit, greyish blood flowed.

"Bad Dobby... The Masters..."

Katya wrenched it from the floor by its clothes and cast a spell on it to literally glue it on the metal table.
She then crudely healed it, and the wound on its forehead stopped bleeding.

"**Its masters are linked to Hogwarts' future problems,**" Vladmir groaned.

"**I'm thinking the same thing,**" Katya nodded, looking at her nephew.
His anger was tangible.
His trouble happened, Vlad would make it a priority to protect his friends.

"What events?" Vladmir repeated.

"Dobby... can't...
Dobby is under a contract...
Dobby wanted to warn Harry Potter...
The great Harry Potter must not go back to Hogwarts.
The bad magic... It..."

Vlad and Katya exchanged a dark look as the small elf sobbed again.
They would not get anything more out of it.
As with all the members of its race linked to a wizarding House or family, he had to keep its masters' secrets."

"How do you enter the palace?" Vladmir asked slowly.

"Debby..." the small creature squealed.

Katya forwned when she heard the name of the young Kemenov House elf.
Through the tears of the creature, the two Russians understood that they shared blood, as they were probably cousins, and that their magical signature were nearly identical.
Dobby was able to get inside without any constraint.

They left the room several hours later, sending Dobby back to its masters, but only after casting a few constraining charms on it.
Vlad had had a twinge of sadness when he saw that the elf seemed shocked that he used Dark Magic, but he held his and his clan's safety as a priority.
The creature could never tell of his link with Debby nor his ability to infiltrate the Kemenov palace with impunity.

The sky was getting lighter when Vladmir got to his room and he sprawled on his bed, muttering.
he was still sore from the Summer Race, and he had to get to the Kappa Quay to buy the last of his school supplies.

"_You should not get back on the bed_", Sasha hissed softly while curling up on his collarbone.
"_You will sleep again_..."

Vlad made a scornful sound, but he listened to the small viper and got up, before disappearing for a fraction of a second into his walk-in wardrobe.
He got back impeccably dressed with dark but refined clothes, made with a dark green fabric.
His hair was left free for once and cascaded over his shoulders, only the strands falling over his eyes were held back by a silver clip.
Tradition was that the heirs of great lines of wizards left their hair loose when they went out...
