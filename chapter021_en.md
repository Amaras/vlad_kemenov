## Chapter 21: The Premises of a network in Hogwarts

"So, Draco, is Dobby your mother's personal elf?" Vladmir asked him a month after the school year started.

The Malfoy heir looked at his friend, wrinkling his nose in a dicreet pout, although it was obvious for one who knew him.
Vlad had not forgotten the incident with the House Elf.
Draco had managed to not push the subject during their discussions, avoiding difficult subjects like those.
The Slytherin had been mortified when the Russian had become upset that say, although he feared repurcussions if it was indeed a Malfoy family elf.

"Yeah," he finally said, looking at the lake.
"My mother owns a House Elf named Dobby."

"Is he for her exclusive use?"

"Not that I know of..." the young noble conceeded.

Vladmir stayed silent for a few long minutes.

They were standing on the rocks of a small creek, at the mouth of the river and the lake.
This place was out of sight from the castle, as well as next to the Forbidden Forest.
Not many people dared to explore spots so close the the dark woods, especially this far from Hogwarts.
It was, however, one of the places that the two heirs prefered in the Hogwarts grounds, facing the dark waters of the lake.
Hermione had laughed when she had discovered where they were hiding, declaring it was just like Vlad: mysterious and wild.
The Scottish moor, arid and windswept on one side, the Forbidden Forest with its oppressive atmosphere on the other, with the lake like a liquid mirror in the middle, its surface as dark as their natural magic.

"Can you summon him please?"

Draco slowly turned to his friend.
He recognised how important this demand was in his friend's tone of voice, and it worried him, even if he didn't show anything.

"One can't Apparate in Hogwarts," Draco remarked.

The young Russian smiled, seemingly amused although his eyes stayed cold and serious.

"House Elves do not use magic like ours, Draco.
Hogwarts is accessible to them.

Draco sighed, and called Dobby firmly.
To his regret, his mother's elf appeared, wearing the family's livery and bowed down, ignoring Vlad who was behind his back.
Draco looked back at his friend, and sighed again.
According to the dark glow in his eyes, Dobby was undeniably the Elf that had broken into their St-Petersburg home.

"Dobby, shut up and stay immobile."

Vlad nodded to Draco, thanking him for his order and saw him shiver in response.
He had put his cold mask back on, and it made the blond one undeniably uneasy.

"Hello Dobby," Vladmir whispered, walking in front of the magical creature, "remember me?"

The House Elf was shaking, but he did not say a word and did not try to flee, under the constraint imposed by his young master's order.
However, anyone could see that terror was in every fibre of his being.
Draco gave pained grin.
Apparently, the Russian had made a strong impression on Dobby when they first met, and it pained Draco.
Even if he was not the most competent and bit wacky around the edges, he was a good servant and was part of his House.
He had to intervene before Vlad traumatised him...

"Let me interrogate him, please," Draco eventually said, a slight tint of torment in his voice that he cursed himself for detecting.

Vlad raised an eyebrow while looking at him, before slowly sitting back.
Draco gave him a tense smile, realising he had just asked a favour that his friend could have outright refused.
Dobby had offended the Kemenov Clan, by appearing without a coat-of-arms, and Vlad could have claimed his right of contempt adnd demand to do it himself...

"Dobby, "the young Malfoy murmurred.
"I order you to answer my questions.
Do you understand?"

"But...
If the Mistress..."


"Is Lady Malfoy married to Lucius according to the ancient marital laws?" Vlad cut him, thoughtful.

"Yes," Draco answered.
"But..."

"Then your orders as heir override hers.
Only your father and, in case of a different person, you Head of family can override yours."

Vlad smiled when he was Dobby swallow, uneasy.
Draco only looked at him, suprised.
He was not aware of this peculiarity in the ancient marital laws.
His Slytherin mind immediately took note of the advantages that it could bring him, and what better way to thank his friend than to give him what he wanted?

"You did you break into the Kemenov home?"

"I... Dobby has..." the small elf started, his eyes filled with tears.

"I demand to know the truth by my right as heir, Dobby.
Take your time to formulate your answer clearly and completely."

Vladmir pouted appreciatively.
He perfectly remembered the stutters the magical creature had last time and did not want to hear them again.
They were unbearable.
Dobby breathed in and out several times, and opened his huge and humid eyes to stare at his young master.

"Lady Malfoy has introduced a Dark Magic artifact in Hogwarts.
Dobby does not know what it is, but darkness was so present around the Mistress that it can only be bad.
She wants Mister Harry Potter-Kemenov to die."

"Why does she want me dead?"

"Answer Vladmir's questions, Dobby, it's better for you."

Once again, the elf took the time to think about his answer, then dared to look into Vladmir's eyes, respect and weariness in his eyes.

"Her master wants to come back.
You are Harry Potter-Kemenov, the Boy-Who-Lived."

Vlad saw Draco become pale when hearing about a master, while he grimaced upon hearing teh nickname the English newpapers had given him.
Draco stayed [upright] in front of his elf, pride taking over fear.
This new fact reminded him of the chat with his friends at the start of the year, and the Slytherin prayed that Dobby would answer negatively.

"Dobby, has mother gone to Russia this summer?"

"She has, the Mistress was gone for a week in Easter European countries.
She went to see friends, and take the opportunity of her transit in St-Petersburg to do some shopping."

"What friends?" the Malfoy heir asked with an emotionless voice.

"The Mistress visited Lady Dolohov and Lord Darerine."

"Ilyna Saprovna Dolohov and Felix Demetrovitch Darerine?"

Vladmir was increasingly interested, leaning forwards, his arms on his thoughs.
Dobby nodded silently as Draco closed his eyes.
He vaguely knew a Dolohov, a Death Eater locked away in Azkaban, but he never heard those two names.
Vladmir, on the contrary, seemed to know who those people were, and due to his dark eyes, the Slytherin did not want to know why.
Dejected, he hesitated to ask a question, _the_ question, but Vladmir asked it himself.

"Does Lord Malfoy know?"

"He does not.
The Mistress has told Dobby to say nothing to the masters, except if they specifically asked for the location of her holidays and the name of her friends."

"Do you have other questions, Vlad?" Draco weakly asked, praying for the discussion to be over soon.
To his horror, the Russian nodded, and he mentally prepared to recieve another bad news.

"Are you linked somehow to the incident on Platform 9 3/4?"

"Dobby is not, Sir.
However, a large-scale magical perturbation was felt by all magical creatures, Mister Harry Potter-Kemenov, Sir.
It was probably the cause of the disruption of magical transports."

Vlad looked at his friend and nodded slightly.
He did not have any more questions for the elf.
Draco dismissed him after having forbidden him from revealing the content of this discussion to his mother.
His face was then drained of any remaining colour it had let, and Draco collapsed on the rocks of the little creek, his eyes fixed on the water.

"My mother, Vlad...
What has my mother done?"

Vladmir kneeled next to him and put a comforting hand on his shoulder.
Narcissa Malfoy had met with two former lieutenants of Voldemort in Eastern Europe.
Vlad had to tell his aunt about the movements of Voldemort loyalists, and closely monitor what was happening in the school...

It was time to setup his chessboard, but in the meantime, he had to comfort his friend.
It took him some time, and he knew Draco was more affected than he wanted to let on.
Their meeting with the dark mage the previous year was still fresh in Draco's memory, and even if it was not traumatic, the danger was real.
The Slytherin had just lost his comforting illusions.
Only Lucius was known as a Death Eater, and Draco had just discovered that his mother was more involved that he believed.

A full hour after taht, Draco had finally regained his composure and went to his Transfiguration class with Gryffindor, while Vlad joined Kevin and the rest for a two-hour class of Defence Against Dark Arts.

His afternoon was definitely going to be crap, the Russian thought as he saw the classroom door open.
He gritted his teach while walking in.
He was angry before the class even started.
The furutre problems Narcissa Malfoy caused, notably the question of the Dark Magic artefact, were turning again and again in his mind.
Fortunately, he would have time to think about it without being bothered...

He had taken the decision to stay discreet from the moment of his first meeting with Lockhart in the greenhouses to avoid any harassment.
Since the beginning of the year, Kevin and Vlad were hiding at the back of the classroom, helped with a discreet but powerful spell that made them nearly disappear to the professor's eyes.
Thanks to that, he had managed to avoid the flagrant attention of the man on _Harry Potter_, even though Flitwick presumably had a few harsh words with Lockhart on the subject of his name.
As for avoiding him in the corridors...
Let's just say that Vlad could have been a hide-and-seek champion.
As soon as he saw blond hair or a blinding smile, he ran in the opposite direction, all his friends helping him in that endeavour.

Either that, or the dumbass that played Professors would have been massacered already, and it was especially true on that day.

Sighing, Vlad settled slowly next to evin, who activated the spell with a flick of his wand, whispering the incantation.
Thank Merlin Lockhart had chosed to never reproduce the catastrophy that happened with the Gryffindors, and did not brind any more creature in his class.
That, however, made the lectures very theoretical and utterly boring.
Next to him, Kevin sighed and got the previous Defence book, the one that was asked for second-years before Lockahrt required his entire bibliography.

Vlad, quite unmotivated, closed his eye and layed down on the table.
He forced himself to think about anything other than Voldemort and Lady Malfoy, and he thnkafully had the opportunity to.
He had a mission for the Mirage Court.

A month had passed since the start of the year.
A month during which his friends had taken the time to accept his reality.
Not that they did not accept it when they had discovered the Mirage Court, but they had to take some time to understand all the implications.
Being a member of the Mirage Court came with duties, even at their young age.
Neville and Vladmir were active members, they thus had missions and had to follow some hierarchy...
However, when they were at school, work was rare.

Except when it came to Hogwarts.

And that morning, Vladmir and Neville both received a mission order.
If the _Underground_ was officially dissolved, the former members were reassigned to other Courts.
Augusta Longbottom had chosen the _Cour des Miracles_, the French branch of the Court.
Presumably, Neville had received an order to support Vladmir.
He was not a Politician, at least in the Court, and he was to stay in Vladmir's shadow as his right-hand-man, being his assistant in the creation of the future network.

The two members were not idiots.
This mission statement only meant one thing.
The early stages of the revival of the _Underground_, supported by the other Courts.
Other people were probably charged with contacting former members, while they looked for new prospective members in school.
And it implied the creation of an intelligence network in Hogwarts, right under the noses of the Professors.
And it suited Vlad just fine, following Dobby's revelations.
Once the network would be created, any unusual fact would be detected.

To Vlad and Neveille's surprise, Hermione, Kevin and Draco had immediately opted to give them help, unknowingly forming the start of the network in Hogwarts.
They had met in the Alliance's room, and the two boys had explained their mission orders.

"I don't understand," Hermione had said.
"If this network aims to start a new _Underground_, why wouldn't Neville lead it?"

"Because I am not a leader in the Mirage Court hierarchy.
Vlad is a Prince of the Russian Court, a Politician.
He is more able to lead the network than I am.
I am a Mercenary, even if I belong to a Master dynasty.
The aspirations of the Longbottoms, as are mine by the way, are not to be a member of a Triad.
I cannot present as a network leader if I eventually fade into the crowd."

Neville explanations and his refusal to take on the responibility of the entire structure convinced their friends.
They had started to look for potential names and interesting activities, like the smuggling of alcohol, or certains clubs in the school.
Vlad, to their surprise, had chosen to start with the idiot who was their Defence professor.
Lockhart was incompetent in his class and very narcissistic, but he had a talent that was very useful and looked for, that only Vlad knew.

As Lockhart was starting to talk about his favourite subject, himself, Vlad was thinking about how best to use this man.
He already had a good idea, the early stage of which demended that he met him as the end of class, and the outcome was in his pocket.
Vlad was distractedly listening to Lockhart explaining how to managed an Acromentula colony, basing his words on his professional experience.
According to hom, one only had to attract those charming creatures with rabbits and trap them, but Vlad had a different experience with them.
Those giant spiders were immune to most spells and he only knew one efficient solution: running away.

A few minutes before the end, Vlad asked Kevin to cancel his spell.
The young Ravenclaw immediately obeyed, and the professor's gaze immediately went to Vladmir's face, noticing the two scars it harboured, although he was more focused on the one in the form of a lighting bolt.

"Mr Kemenov, please stay!" Lockhart called him out.
Most Ravenclaws and Hufflepuffs gave Vlad a symathetic look while walking briskly to flee the classroom, which made Vlad smile.
Since the beginning, his classmates could see the mediocrity of the teaching, and no girl wanted an autograph any more.

Kevin winked at him and stayed in the classroom, leaning nonchalantly against a wall.
Lockhart, visibly fascinated by Vlad's presence, did not notice that Kevin got his wand out and was starting to play with it, not looking away from the blond man.
He did not notice Kevin casting a Silencing charm on the closed door.
However, the Russian did not miss any gesture from his friend and smiled grimly.
If at the start he had had second thoughts about revealing the underground world of the Mirage Court, his friends adapted remarkably and had adopted the manners of his world.
Although Hermione and Kevin had developped Slytherin-like traits due to their contact with the three heirs, while Draco had already developped them in his family...

"Vlad, Vlad, Vlad..." the man smiled, showing his white teeth.
"Someone as important as yourself should not stay in the shadows!
You have a reputation and a celebrity status to maintain!"

Vlad only raised a mocking eyebrow, which the narcistic man in front of him completely missed.
He did not even seem to ask why he had never noticed Vlad until that day...
Lockhart took his pupil by the shoulders, guiding him to his desk and a tall portrait of himself.

"Look at me, Order of Merlin, and five-times receipient of the Most Charming Smile Award!
This is only a question of publicity.
If you want, my young friend, I can guide you and help you embrace your celebrity, initiate you to interviews, help..."

With a quick gesture, Vlad got out his the man's grip to face him.

"In case you didn't understand, Lockhart, I don't seek celebrity.
And as I had the displeasure to say to a professor before you, we didn't raise hippogriphs together.
I will this ask you to not address me so casually."

"Come on, Vlad..."

Vlad's smile immediately made him shut up.
A cold and sarcastic smile that made the Defence Against the Dark Arts professor step backwards.

"I know who you are, Lockhart.
I know you never did what you claim.
Jeanne Laroche.
Matthew Balcrow.
Achmed Bensaoud...
Do any of those names ring a bell?"

Lockhart had gradually lost his smile as Vlad said the names.
To each of them corresponded one of the acts he had claimed were his own.
With quick gesture, his wand sprang out of his sleeve, but an _expelliarmus_ came from his right.

The professor had a panicked look when he realised that he never noticed Vlad's friend was, which was a source of satisfaction in itself.
Even if Lockhart refused to work with him, Vlad had won this day.
The man that boasted that he was so good at detecting anormal facts and gestures around him never noticed the presence of the young Ravenclaw with an innocent smile who was now playing with two wands.

"Shut you mouth, Lockhart, you're gonna eat Wrackspruts," the falsly innocent Ravenclaw mocked him.
And Gilderoy opened his eyes wide when he noticed that he could not remember this child name, nor that he never saw him during his lectures.

"You... You..."

"We, yes," Vladmir said, amused, as he sat down on the professor's desk.
"I have a deal for you."

"What is it?" the man asked with a feeble voice.

"Your Obliviator services, under oath, against out silence about the source of your... accomplishments."

"How...?"

"How?
Your real name is Marcus O'Balley, Obliviator for the Irish Department of Magical Accidents.
Officially disappeared twelve years ago, you graduated with honours.
You changed your physical appearance and your magical aura with a Dark Magic spell, which allowed you to avoid recognition."

"How..." Lockhart repeated, before growing pale.
"You're with _them_.
You're with the Mirage Court."

Vlad's smile turned carnivorous, as Kevin softly laughed.
Neither of the boys denied his allegations, although Kevin did not strictly belong to the Court.

"He's not as stupid as he look," Kevin mused.

"Well, appearances are deceiving," Vladmir agreed.

They could see Lockhart's train of thought, stopping first on their age, then their smiling face, before going to the young Russian's forehead.
He was visibly hesitated between laughing in their face, or taking them very seriously.

Gilderoy Lockhart, or rather Marcus, had already met young teenagers raised by the Mirage Court in Ireland.
When he had called upon the Irish Court to illegally change names, the one who contacted him was a fifteen-year-old boy.
Even if he faced two twelve-year-old children, he had quickly understood that being young was not synonymous with being weak...
Lockhart definitely lost his smile and became more serious as he realised the significance of Vlad's words.
He was indebted to the Irish Court, and having a debt with them was very bad if its men took a hold of him.
His only relief was that he was in Hogwarts.
The Mirage Court could do nothing in the school premices.

"Apparently you tried to scam the _Chúirt Ríoga_.
You know the price, I presume."

This time, blood fled the Defence Aagainst Dark Arts Professor's face, as he remembered the newpapers talking about the discovery of Gregorovitch's dead body suspended over Gringott's last year.
Slowly, Lockhart wiped the sweat off his face and nodded.

"I... I can pay my debts," he whispered while looking at the two Ravenclaws.

Only their rounded faces allowed him to remember that they were children.
The calculating shine in Vladmir's gaze was scaring him, but strangely was was terrified of the other one.
His light blue eyes were shining with innocence and malice, his smile was playful...
But he was the one playing with two wands, nonchalantly leaning on the wall.
He was the one whose face he did not remember, so much so that he was convinced he never saw him before.
A second-year Ravenclaw...
They were a handful and he had probably been in all classes, and yet!

"How?" Vlad asked, cutting Lockhart's train of thought short with a sneer...
As if...

The young Kemenov's smile widened and the professor swallowed hard.
The kid was reading his mind.

"I..."

"Here is the deal I propose," Vladmir smiled, "under a binding magical contract this time.
Our silence for your talents as both an observer, and an Obliviator."

"But that's..."

"Would you rather we contacted the Irish Court directly?" Kevin asked without looking at him.
The young Muggle-Born was impressed by his friend's Slytherin side, even if he did not show it for now.
Although going to the professor directly like that was pretty Gryffindor of him...
Vladmir had just proposed his silence against his services... without promissing any protection against the Irish Court.
He would simply not talk about Lockhart to his contacts in the _Chúirt Ríoga_.
He was not sure of the significance of the magical contract, but he would have time to ask afterwards.

Vladmir, for his part, was holding back his laughter when he saw that his friend had understood his plan without having been informed first.
Kevin was undeniably a Ravenclaw, his intelligence was definitely dangerous and he had a remarkable adaptibility.

LOckhart did not really have a choice, and he closed his eyes, preparing to take an Unbreakable Vow.
He slowly raised his hand, but Vladmir smiled mockingly.

"Oh not, dear Marcus...
Not an Unbreakble Vo, a _magical contract_."

He took a parchement and scarlet quill from his pocket, and gave them to Lockhart.

"But that's..."

"A Blood Quill.
Don't you know that magical contracts require the blood of the signataries?"

Lockhart feebly nodded before reading the contract.
Although short, it was perfectly detailed.

> Magical contract between Gilderoy Julius Lockhart, né Marcus Garry O'Balley, and Vladmir Vassilievitch Kemenov, né Harry James Potter.
>
> Witness Kevin Warren Entwhistle.
>
> Mister G.J. Lockhart shall:
>
> - Transmit to V.V. Kemenov any abnormality, any information that is primordial to the school's safety and all suspicious behaviour from student or staff in the school premices, during the whole term of his contract as professor.
>
> Answer summons from V.V. Kemenov in any circumstance and as quickly as possible, except in cases of grave physical or moral incapacity.
>
> Keep private the identities of V.V. Kemenov and K.W. Entwhistle and their implication in the Mirage Court, except with the express oral permission of V.V. Kemenov.
>
> Never endanger the life or security of V.V. Kemenov and K.W. Entwhislte, directly or indirectly.
>
> Mister V.V. Kemenov shall
>
> - Keep private the birthname of G.J. Lockhart and his location from the Chúirt Ríoga, Irish branch of the Mirage Court.

"But it's unfair!" Lockhart took offense after reading the single line that described Vladmi's part.

"How much do you value your life?" Kevin asked, after discreetly reeding the contract over the professor's shoulder.

It was enough.
The man took the quill, and quickly signed, yelping with pain when his signature was engraved in his hand.

Vladmir and Kevin signed in turn, and the scroll immediately disappeared, magically sent to the Kemenov vaults in the Russian branch of Gringott's.
Then, taking a vial of potion from his pocket, the Russian boy healed their wounds, before abandonning an overhelmed professor.
