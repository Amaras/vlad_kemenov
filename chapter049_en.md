# Chapter 49: Arrival of the Delegations

Vladmir was rummaging through the shelves…
_His_ shelves.
He knew exactly what he was looking for, but not how it would present itself.
because of this, he was reading over all the books present in each of the shelves of his mental library.

After he had turned over three quarters of his mind, he resolved to search a specific sector.
He had hoped he would not have to go there, but he did not have much of a choice.
Aslo, now that he thought about it, Vladmir had to admit that it was quite logical.
The parasite was holed up among his worst memories, where he went the least often.
Where its darkness would jump to him less than among the joyful moments with Nevile or Kevin.

The young Russian sighed and rubbed his arms in an unconscious reassuring gesture.
The idea to ask for Severus's help came to mind, but he pushed it back.
He would only ask when he would decide to directly face the Horcrux.
Meanwhile, he had to find it.

Slowly, he went to a particular door.
A door that Severus had helped him to close long ago.
Vladmir took a strangely-shaped key and unlocked the door.
The click rang out, he inhaled deeply, before pushing the heavy wood panel.

The shelves there, contrary to the rest of the library, were of a dark oak reflecting the darkness of the thoughts in this particular room.

Vlamdir closed his eyes and let his feelings guide him.
Slowly, his hand ran along the books as he followed his instincts and his magic to detect the Dark Magic waves that would obviously emanate from the Horcrux's hiding place.

_ Big grey eyes full of suffering…
A human form severely injured
