## Chapter 30: The Five Families

Lucius Malfoy finally felt at peace.

It had been a long time since he had felt this calm.
He started to live again a few months ago, while he had only survived before, for the sake his son.

Howver, meeting Katya Kemenov had changed many things.
She had turned his world upside down, both by her presence, and what she embodied.
Seh had given him a new hope.

The Lord swished the amber liquid in his glass, and brushed the marks on his right forearm.
Two marks which, if discovered, would bring him straight to jail, each for its own reason.
He had managed to hid the most important one in his trial a few yeards before.
Not his Dark Mark, it was not core to his being.
Adittedly, he had to accept the errors he made in his youth, but the most important tatoo in his eyes showed he was one of the uncontested leaders of one of the most powerful organisations in the world.

While he was ashamed of the former, the latter only brought it pride.
Voldemort was only a floatin shadow, and the _Underground_ wild rise again, bringging him comfort...

He would finally be able to avenge his friends.
A gloomy smiled stretched his lips.
Orion and Julius did not deserve to die in the agony the Dark Lord had put them in.

Lucius felt awful thinking that the one responsible for this was peacefully sleeping a dozen metres away, free and unpunished.
He had needed fifteen years to be aware of his wife's true alligeance.
Narcissa Malfoy was just like her dear sister Bellatrix, a complete and servile admirer of the Dark Lord, although she was not as public about it...
She was a true Slytherin, hiding her emotions and thoughts, playing a prefect role at his side.

Lucius finished his drink in one gulp, and put the glass down, his head turning to the guest wing.
Katya was probably sleeping at this time, as was her nephew.
It was hard to know that the woman he loved was at his home, so close...
They had only known each other for one year at this point, but Lucius admired this strong and independant woman...
However, even though Lucius was not an angel, he had principles and honour.
He was married, and had sworn a vow of faithfulness and wedded bliss, and he was not a man to break his promises.

Wedded bliss indeed...
The only good thing that came out of this marraged arranged with Narcissa by his father was Draco.
Draco had been his only source of joy and pride, and tonight, he had finally entered the world.
And what an introduction!

This time, the smile he gave the landscape was genuine.
He turned the English polite society upside down in just one ball.
Indeed, this evening was fruitful...
Two talented Muggle-Borns presented, and thus officially under his protection, the return of the Prince line, an imporbable alliance with the Longbottoms...
He was impatient and curious to read the next editions of the newspapers.

Narcissa was furious about his initiatives, and she had yelled at him in their private appartements.
Fortunately, they had separate bedrooms, or she might not have survived the night.
He could not bear her hatred of Muggle-Borns any more.
Birth was not everything, and especially not magical power.
One only had to look at the sons of the Crabbe and Goyle families, and then at his son's friends.

To calm his wife down, Lucius had needed to used his status as his husband under the Anciant Laws, and ordered her not to speak to him this way again.
The start of his vengence, in a way.

A silent scratch on his office door pierce the slience in the room.
With a slient spell, he opened the door to his nightly visitor.
To his surprise, Vladmir Kemenov silently walked towards him, and sat down next to him when he got his permission.

Lucius stared at the young Kemenov and Potter heir.
The legend of the Five Families said that one of them descended from Merlin.
He knew that his old friend, Severus, knew which family was the one of the king of England.
He would not be surprised if it eventually were Vladmir.
The boy had the needed nobility, power, and assertiveness.
He was the Tsesarevitch of Russia, why not the Prince of the Magical Kingdom of England?

Vladmir seemed to feel Lucius's gaze, because he slowly turned his head towards him, his troubled green eyes gazing at his host's grey ones.

"Are you alright, Vladmir?" Lucius asked softly.
The ball had finished three hours before, the boy should have been fast asleep in his bedroom.

"I am, it was just a nightmare..."

"A nightmare that keeps you awake.3

It was the only opening that Lucius was capable of.
He was not used to comforting people, especially not children, but Vlad understood his intent.

"I saw the death of a person dear to me again."

"Your cousin."

Vladmir raised an eyebrow at this delcaration, and smiled slightly.

"I was judge for you duel and I remember the young undead you opponent summoned.
She was Natashka Aleksandrovna Romanov, wasn't she?"

"Indeed.
Few people know we were cousins.
I saw her as a little sister, but she was at the core of our clan."

"Death touches all, without regard to age, class, or power, Vladmir Vassilievitch.3

Lucius had heard about the last of the Romanov, granddaughter of Archduchess Anastasia, whose corpse was never found [1].
Vladmir did not answer, and turned his attention to the scenary.
The moon lit up the snowed-up countryside, and some snowflakes flew in the wind.
It was beautiful...

"I know," the young Russian eventually whispered, catching the Lord's attention, who had turned back to his dark thoughts.
He did not answer, letting the child continue.

"I know you love my aunt.
I am grateful for that.
To know that she found someone who accepts her as she is.

Lucius stayed silent once more.
He could not contradict Vladmir.
The aristocratic women could be powerful, but they generally were eclipsed by their husbands.
They were more comfortable in a soirée or a drawing room, than in a duel or on a battlefield.
Women of Katya Kemenov's caliber, leading a clan and fully endossing that responsibility, were rare.
She was a warrior, a strong and independant woman who did not let anyone walk all over her, but who was capable to secure her status in society.

"Did you want to tell me something?" Lucius asked softly.
It was not really Vladmir's thing, going to him after a nightmare, from what Katya and Draco had told him.

"Indeed...
You will probably not like it, but I think I can understand her."

"What did Narcissa do again?" he asked wearily.
'She' could only refer to his dear wife.

"Who said I was referring to your wife?"

"My instincts are good young men, and rearely betray me."

"Do you remember the Bludger attack during the Quidditch match?"

"How could I forget?" the Lord groaned.
"My son nearly died!"

"I cast a spell before before Neville destroyed it..." the toung Russian carefully started.

"You did.
I was too far away from the silhouette, and unfortuantely even your memory did not help..."

Vladmir took a small ring with a black onyx on it out of his pocket, and gave it to Lucius.
The Lord frowned, turning the ring in his hand.

"It's..."

"The rinig Narcissa wore when we arrived yesterday.
I spent last night trying to remembered why it was familiar."

"On the Bludgeon's silhouette..." the Lord whispered.
With a wand gesture, his glass filled up and he drank it all at once.

"Alcohol is not the best solution to your problems..."

"You are too young to understand," Lucius smiled sadly, looking at his glass frozen over, before remembering the glasses of Ice-vodka the Kemenovs downed as if it were water on the day of the dead.
"Aren't you cold?"

"Not really," Vladmir smiled.
"I am used to the cold.
In Russia, the palaces are so large, and the exterior air so cold that it is around 5°C in most rooms."

Lucius shivered unnoticeably, and Vladmir laughed, adding that it was warmer in the living rooms.

An appeasing silence fell between them.
The did not move from the balcony, and admired the sky slowly light up.

"Did you stay up all night?"

Vladmir and Lucius jumped and turned towards Katya, who announced with an amused smiled that it was six in the morning, and that breakfast was ready.
The Lord was surprised that she did not tell his nephew off ofr sleeping elsewhere as she left them after kissing Vladmir's forehead.

Katya Kemenov was truly different from all the women he kne.

The two men finally stood up and got to the small dinner room, where breakfast was about to be served.

<hr>

The next few days went calmly, between the children's games, the general good humour, and the secret conversations about Narcissa.
Lucius was increasingly colder with his wife, but he did not want to confront her yet.
He was preparing evidence for the Wizengamot and the family court, and it was nearly done.
Before the end of the holidays, he could question her using the Ancient matrimonial laws, notably to know what was attacking the students...

While Lucius, helped by Severus and his friends of the Mirage Court, prepared his vengeand, time for dinner at Amelia Bones' came.
The Kemenovs thus arrived in the residential area of the great families in London, in front of an imposing Victorian home.

Katya observed his nephew in his best outfit climb the stairs of the powerful familiy's manor at her side.
She took the delicately chiselled silver door-knocker and knocked three times.
Immediately, a small House Elf in an immaculate uniform opened the door.
She respectfully bowed and invited them in.

"Mila welcomes you to the noble house of the Bones.
Please follow Mila, Mila will lead you to the mistresses."

"We thank you Mila," Vladmir declared as they followed the small servant in the great entry hall, before leading them in an ancient library.

Amelia Bones was standing in front of the windows, watching the snow fall.
She was tall, her fair but greying hair freely flowed on her back, and she had an undeniable presence.
Her niece, Susan, was standing next to her, and their likeness was striking, even of the young Hufflepuff was ginger.

Vladmir slightly frowned when he noted the presence of other people, before opening his eyes wide when he understood the implications.

Professor Severus Prince was calmly sitting in front of a thick grimoire, focussed on his reading and seemed to not have heard them walk in.
Seemed only, because the slight tensing up in his shoulder revealed he knew they were there.
Samocles and Gwenelle Rowle played with their three-year-old and six-year-old children, and the bump of the young mother meant that a third one would come soon.
Finally, sitting on a sofa while drinking a cup of tea, Theodore Nott Senior and Junior were perfectly straight, conversing in a low voice.

After several generations, the Five Families were coming back together...

"Katya, Vladmir, welcome back in the noble abode of the Bones," Amelia greeted them, turning back to her guests.

Katya walked to her and kissed her cheek, before smiling at Susan, who looked uncomfortable.

"Good morning young girl.
You are charming, and like your mother's living portrait."

"You knew my mother?" Susan was astonished, while Vladmir greeted Amelia, holding back an amused smile.
Katya had a gift to make children relax...
He hasitated fo some time, before paying no heed to the etiquette and going to greet the other adults.
The only one he knew was Professor Prince, and he should have wated that Katya and Amelia introduced him to the others.

Katya smiled at her nephew's initiative, which surpried only Theodore Jr. as Amelia caught everyone's attention and invited them to sit in the drawing room next door.
Katya observed the Rowles entrusting their children to an old House Elf, probably the Bones' childminder, then the Notts.
She did not not what to think of the father, a Death Eater that was never convicted thanks to his family's rank.
However, she found it surprising that a member of the Five Families stooped so low as to serve a man like Voldemort...

"Very well, Susan, Theo, I know that you are not aware of the reason for our presence here.
I know, however, that Theodore and myself told you the history of the Five Families.
You are, or soon will be, twelve years old, the age needed to learn the truth about those lines.

"What is the connection with us, Aunt Amelia?" Susan asked.

"Are we the Five Families," Theo hypothesised, making Vladmir smile.
They exchanged a gaze, and the Russian discreetly nodded.

"Indeed," Damocles declared.
"I think your parents told you about the heir, and the prophecy."

"She did," Susan whispered, before reciting.

> When the Heir and the Spy mingle once more.
>
> When past and future in one blood will fuse
>
> When Darkness on our world will spread
>
> Tragedy will strike the descendents and around the Prince they will gather.
>
> Gawain and Galahad will be dual, the matriarchs watching over them.
>
> Tistan and Percival will be contraries, good against evil, Darkness against Light.
>
> Tragedy will strike the descendants and around the Prince they will gather.
>
> Around the Prince the descendants will gather, and Magic will awake once more.


"Our families are close to the magical creatures," Theodore Nott Senior somberly whispered.
"That is one thing I never accepted when I... followed the Dark Lord.
Theo, I think you noticed that I treat my House Elves extremely well."

"Indeed father," Theo whispered, "I thought it was stranger, although..."

"You never dared ask me about it.
I know."

Theo grimaced slightly and nodded.
He respected his father too much to allow himself this kind of remark.

"Goblins think the prophecy will happen soon," Katya announced.
"Vladmir is close to some of their leaders, and the Lord of England thinks the time is coming in our lifetime."

"What do you mean?" Damocles Rowle asked.

"The prophecy has started to clear up," Amelia responded.
"The Heir and the Spy mingle once again.

"Who is the Heir?"

Susan and Theodore Jr. opened their eyes wude, when they told them, as Severus sneered.
It was admittedly hard for his students to see something other than their Potions Professor.

"I hope you did not think I was ther for nothing?" Severus laughed slightly.

Susan blushed while Theodore smiled.
Apparently, for Hufflepuffs, she finally admitted, Severus Snape was an occult entity linked to the castle.

"Why once more?" Theo asked, barely containing his laughter.
As all the Slytherins, he kenw that his Potions Professor and Head of House was a human and even had a dry humour when they were respectful.

"The Prince line had another spy.
Mordred.
It is a second time one of Arthur's descendants have this role."

"As for the rest of the prophecy?" Susan timidly asked.

"The Darkness are about Voldemort's rise to power," Katya declared, ignoring the shivers passing on most peoples.
"He is not dead, and will come back."

"How is he not back?" Nott Sr. worried.
He had betrayed him in a completely different way to  Severus, cutting his access to his fortuned.
His wife died because of this, and he hated and feared the Dark Mage.

"He is immortal, in the worst way possible.
Past and future in one blodd will fuse...
Vladmir hosts a part of Voldemort's soul.
He was one at the time.
The past is Voldemort.
The future is Vlamdir...
Which explains the Darkness coming back."

"It is slightly obscure," Damocles noted.
"As for the tragedy..."

"The tragedy...
Our families all were hit by tragedies, death is present all around us.
My sister and her husband, Vladmir's parents, Theodore's wife, Severus's mother, Damocles and Gwenelle's first-borns...
We were hit even more strongly by hte disappearance of a Prince heir...
Until Vladmir, Merlin thank you, found Severus's identity.
He is the light around which we turn, even you still have trouble accepting it," Amelia added, smiling.

Severus Prince, formerly Snape, groaned, which made all the adults in the room smile.
It was obvious that he had a hard time thinking he was important.

"Personally, I don't think the Darkness is linked solely to Voldemort," Damocles slowly declared, talking for the first time.
"The one who hurt our families the most until now is Albus Dumbledore.
War is a two-player game, and Voldemort cannot be the only one."

"What do you mean?"

"I am a historian," Damocles slowly answered, "and I am also interested in the hidden history of our world.
The one that, as for Mordred and Morgann, was twisted into propaganda.
Many forget that Dumbledore was the lover and first supporter of Gellert Grindelwald.
That he was the professor of the one we know as Lord Voldemort.
I am... was one of his closest friends, and he is not as magnanimous and lenient as he wants people to believe."

"And for the knight-mages?" Gwenelle asked.

"Gawain is the Potters' ancestor.
Galahad sired the Bones.
The matriarchs, Katya and Amelia, watch over their descendants...
Triastan and Percival sired the Nott and Rowle respectively.
Nott is in Nordic mythology the personification of night, therefore night.
Rowle is derived from owl, Athena's symbol representing the light of knowledge...
Light against Light."

Vladmir grumbled words in Russian, imrpessed, and Katya laughed out lood.

"Vladmir just said that prophecies are really obscure and twisted, and that one had to be like that to interpret them," she laughed.
"He is not wrong."

"I don't understand the thing about Gawain and Galahad's duality," Vladmir suddenly raised.
"Gawain and Galahad will be dual, the matriarch watching over them.
I don't see how Susan and I are dual.
Unless..."

He observed his aunt, then Susan's.

"Duality could be between us..." Katya slowly agreed, observing Amelia elegantly raising an eyebrow, reajusting her monocle.

"And how would that be, dear?"

Katya looked at Amelia Bones for a long time.
There was a rule between the Five Families.
What was said stayed between them, and that dated back to life on Avalon.
They knew many family secrets.

"You represent the law.
I am the leader of the Russian maffia.
I don't know how some people could be more dual."

Theodore Nott spat out his tea, while Gwenelle chocked on her biscuits.

"You belong to the Mirage Court?" Amelia asked, shocked.

"What is the Miracle Court?" Susan softly asked.

"Mirage Court," Katya distractedly corrected her, not leaving her eyes off Amelia Bones, still frozen in shock.

"The international and illegal criminal network of the magical world.
They are the underworld of our society.
Assassination, contraband, theft, clandestine smugglin..."

"You are well informed," Severus Prince noted, completely expressionless, staring at Gwenelle who blushed slightly.

"I am a jurist," the young mother justified, as Damocles softly pressed her arm.
"The Mirage Court is the worst scourge of our world."

"Be carefule Gwenelle," Katya declared with a sweet voice.
"We are not the worse in the magical world."

"You gather the worse dregs of our world!
I don't understand how a woman of a so prestigious line could join this organisation.
I thouht you had some common sense!"

"When..." her husband tried to calm her.

"Please let her talk Damocles, I am curious to know what her gripes about us are."

"You are the leader of the worst criminal network in the world!
The Russians are the most dangerous, and you are their leader!"

"Dear, we have a strict hierarchy, all our missions are validated and authorized.
Contrary to what you believe, the worst crime are not ours."

"You."

"Out of the cases before a penal Court, only 10% are because of Mirage Court actions," Katya coldly declared.
"The monsters are not the ones we believe, Gwenelle Role.
Ask your husband, I think he knows the history of the Mirage Court well.
And know that what happens and is said between the Five Familes stays a secret between us.
If I learn that my implicated was revealed, I will know who did it."

"Gwen, let it go," Damocles whispered to her.

"Although I am against the Mirage Court, I have to agree with Katya on statistics," Amelia conceded.
"It regulates crime efficiently, like an internal police.
And what is said here stays a secret," she coldly said to Lady Rowle.

"How would you prevent me from..."

"A Memory Charm," Theodore Nott intervened.
"I would not hesitate Madam...
I am a Death Eater," he continued, ignoring Gwenelle Rowle's pale face, "and I would like you to know that the Mirage Court never worked for the Dark Lord, on the contrary, it was part of the most active and efficent resistance!
It was the bane of his existence, until he managed to capture and execute its leaders, making it disappear from England."

Vladmir attentively observed their reactions.
Unsurprisingly, his to schoolmates were lost, Katya was angry, as was his Potions professor, although they hid it well, Amelia seemed upset at the news, Theodire Nott was amused, and Damocles Rowle was disappointed by his wife's attack.

"Welcome to the Five Families," Vladmir sneered, catching captivated or incredulous looks.
"United against all odds, whatever our values.
Let's get back to the prophecy, shall we?"

"I think all was said, wasn't it?" Gwenelled said, frowning.

"What would the... magic awakening allow?" Theo wondered, visibly not understanding the tension betwenn the adults.

"According to legend, Arthur's descendant is the keeper of Ancient Magic.
The one surrounding us."

"The core of the Kingdom, the nexus of magic, is Avalon!" Amelia whispered, adjusting her monocle.

"Avalon is a myth!" Theo exclaimed.
"Furthermore, I thought Arthur's capital was Camelot?"

"You should read the classics more closely, Theodore," Katya sighed.
"Avalon was the ancient city of the wizard-kings.
Camelot wasthe Muggle part.
Magical creatures still know where the island is.
All magical creatures know, but I fear that they would not entrust a wizard the secret, even the prince.
Not after all the hunts and injustices they suffered."

"What would the ancient magic's return do?" Susan asked.

"The English magical world is dying.," Theodore Nott answered.
"Fertility rates are the lowest they have ever been.
Muggle-Borns are increasingly more numerous, but rarely stay in our world because of discrimination.
Ancient Magic is... life.
It is hard to explain.
It is nature itself, the one giving us life.
Its return would renew our society."

"You... I do not wish to be king," Severus declared.

"I suspected it, Severus," Theodore Sr. said with a smile.
"You never liked being the center of the attention...
However, the return of Ancient magic does not necessarily mean return of royalty.
Only a fairer world, and the renewal of society."

"So... we need to find Avalon?" his son asked.

Only silence ansered him...
Alliances between people so different, yet so close, were hard to make.
For the Five Families, Ancient Magic was essential, it governed the nature of magical beings, wizards and witches, creatures, plants...
It was the essence that gave them life.
Its preservation, or even better, its return, was a dream that they could achieved if they found the ancient city of Avalon.

That is what Vladmir thought, sitting on one of the window sills in Lucius Malfoy's office, the day before classes started back in January.
Looking back at his holidays, Vlad was satified.
The Five Families met again, his engagement with Susan was annulled, and now, it was time to finish certain things.

Vladmir was nearly invisible, while Katya and Augusta was conversing with the Lord.
The Malfoy patriarch had refused to let his son and his friends in, apart from Vladmir, thinking the coming questionning was not for them.
Neville could have been there, but Augusta had chosen not to involve him.

"You asked to see me Lu... cius?"

Narcissa froze when she saw the two women sitting in the armchairs in his husband's office.
It was a rare thing to see Lucius Malfoy allowing strangers in his sanctuary.

"I did, come in Cissy and sit down," her husband softly said.

The woman sat down, slightly tense.

"If you wanted to talk about my row with young Granger, I..."

"I did not want to speak about that," Lucius gowled, "although your bahaviour vexed me greatly."

Seeing his wife covertly insulting the young Gryffindor under his roof, even after he had clearly showed that the two Muggle-Borns were under his protection had made him furious, and only the presence of his guests and Kevin's wit saved Narcissa from his wrath.

"What do you want to talk about?" his wife asked, unsure.

"Many things," he answered, "and in front of the Ancient laws, I order you to answer me."

The ambiant magic crakled, as the link between the two spouses imposed Lucius's order on Narcissa.
She blushed with anger and tried to stand up, but Lucius, sitting behind his desk, gave her a menacing look.

"Sit. Down."

The voice rang out in the office, and Vlamdir, until there lost in his thoughts, turned his head towards the adults.
Lucius was showing his public face, which he had rearely seen, and Narcissa seemed quite frail compared to her husbands presence and charsima.

"Roll up your sleeve."

Narcissa, this time, paled but started to roll up her left sleeve.
The now dark gaze of her husband made her stop and rool up her right sleeve.
Her skin, milky white, was clear, and Lucius seemed surprised.

"Glamour," Katya commented, having stayed silent until now.

Narcissa looked dagger at her, at which point Katya smiled slowly and pointed her wand on the woman's delicate arm.
She moaned when the Dark Mark was revealed.

"So you serve the Dark Lord," Lucius coldly noted.

"I fix the mistakes you did for the Master," Narcissa coldly responded, becoming as impersonal and haughty as usual.

"He never was my master.
He was a skilled manipulator and genious orator, however he primarily was a psychopath and a mudered," Lucius calmly said, crossing his hands in front of his face.

"You followed im for years," his wife countered.

"I value my life, and you don't leave his service alive."

"You swore allegiance."

I did not, I was marked like cattle, a mere slave to have followed Abraxas's advice.
I never swore a magical oath linking myself to this being."

"Your father showed you the way, as did mine."

"He was not my father, only my progenitor.
Fatherhood requires, if not love, at least respect.
I do not feel this for Abraxas.
Was it your father that asked you to betray your line, your uncle, and your husband?"

"I did what the Master wished to give you exclusive leadership of the Mirage Court!
You helped the Master until the International Organisation disbarred the _Underground_, and I always encouraged you to restart contacts for his service."

"Verily, I disbanded the English branch to prevent this... being from using," Lucius revealed.

"You... lied to me? For all those years?" Narcissa stuttered.

"As if you were absolutely truthful," Lucius sneered.
"'My place is next to my huband, not in the Lord's ranks'.
'My son is my most precious treasure, Lucius'."

"I did not lie!" Draco's mother suddenly exclaimed

All could this that his was a sentistive spot for her, because she undeniably loved her son.
However, Lucius was a true Slytherin, he had touched on a raw nerve.

"And yet you tried to kill our son in Hogwarts."

"What? No!"

"Then what was that murderous Bludger doing?
Without his friends, our son would be dead.
Why did you charm this Bludger?"

The question was direct and perfectly clear, Narcissa could do little but answer it.

"Is this a judgment?" she tried to avoid.

"Answer."

"I wanted him to leave the school," the woman answered relunctantly.
"If he was injured, I could have demanded to get him back hom, and he would have been protected."

"Protected from what?"

"From... I don't know," she admitted, "although it aims the Master's return."

"Quite logical.
The Heir of Slytherin is Voldemort.
Does this have a link with the charmed diary?" Vladmir asked without looking at her.
Down in the gardens, he could see his friends having a lively snowball battle, and Draco had charmed a snowman to help him and Hermione beat Neville and Kevin, ho were hiddend behind a flowerbed.
He could nearly hear them laugh, oblivious that two floors up, Draco's mother fate was being sealed.

Narcissa Malfoy paled even more, if at all possible, and looked at the two women fearfully, trying to get their symapthy.
UNtil she realised that Augusta Longbottom wore the _Underground_'s symbol, and Katya proudly showed the Russian Triads tatoo.

"Answer," Lucius repeated.

"Yes."

"What link with Voldemort?"

"I... I received the order to sneak it in Hogwarts, although I do not know more!"

"Order from whom?
Dolohov and Darerine?
Is that why you lied last summer and you travelled to Easter Europe?
Do not lie, Vladmir recognised you in Russian."

"Yes," Narcissa said, lowering her head.

"Where did you find this journal?"

"The Lord gave it to me fifteen years ago, I had hidden it in the middle of the Dark section of the library."

"Did Voldemort give something similar to you?" Augusta questionned her.

"No."

"One of your family members?"

"My sister.
A cup."

Vladmir and Katya looked at each other, a huge doubt growing in their mind.
Vlad was a Horcrux, they had known for a long time...
However, according to their friend Rasputin, he could never have been if Voldemort had not weakened his soul by splitting it before.
The diary was probably a Horcrux, but how many did he do before?"

"To whom are you loyal?" Lucius slowly asked.

"To the Master."

The answer was instantaneous, without any regret, and Lucius did not even ask anything more.

"I repudiate you, Narcissa," the Lord enunciated clearly.

"You cannot!" his wife screamed.
"Think about our son, to the Malfoy's reputation!"

"I think about our son, Narcissa," Lucius coldly said.
"He is precicely the reason why I don't demand your blood for your treason."

"If you repudiate me, I reveal your implication as a Triad to the Wizengamot!"

"Is this blackmail?" the Lord was amused, not even slightly scared by the threat.

"Your reputation will be ruined, and I will drag you in the mud.
You betrayed the Master, you betrayed your vow with his woman!
Indeed, I know you have an affait with her!"

Katya raised an eybrow as well, amused, but terribly terrofying.

"Have you aver warmed Voldemort's bed?
Something tells me you did.
After all, I know for a fact that Bellatrix did, so I wondered if that was your case."

Vladmir looked at Katya, surprised, who gave him an apologetic smile.
He was still quite young to have access to this kind of information..."

"Narcissa?"

"N..."
The woman could not answer, the initial order preventing her from lying, as Lucius's eyes glowed with fury.
A tear rolled on Narcissa's pale cheek.

"You accuse me to have broken our vows," the man whispered.
However, the only whore here is yourself.
I love Katya, houwever our relationship is purely platonic.
I was faithful for the duration of our marriage, contrary to you, and if Draco did not look as much like me, I would ask for a lineage potion..."

Narcissa reacted as if she was slapped.
Indeed, Lucius knew how to hurt with words...

"If you dare speak about my work relations, I will demand the use of Veritaserum on your relationship with your Master," the Lord declared.

"Nobody will believe a Death Eater and a Triad," she answered with flair.
She seemed to have completely forgetten that other people were in the room, as she was having a staring contest with her husband...

"Who would suspect the venerable Augusta Longbottom?" Neville's grandmother whispered with a nasty smile.
"You are responsible for the death of many family members, in the Court or my blood family.
I think Lucius is way too lenient with you..."

The now Lady Malfoy turned her head to her spouse, fear finally in her eyes.
Her position was maintained only through her marriage, which is why she fought so hard to keep it.
Her rank in the Death Eater was only because of her links to the Malfoy clan.

"You are repudiated, Narcissa.
I have a case against you, and I will not hesitated to use it if you cause me trouble.
I know you truly love Draco, and I such, I give you a small property in the London countryside, as well as a monthly income of 500 Galleons.
It will not sustain your current lifestyle, but is way more than most wizards and witches earn.
