## Chapter 35

Lucius sighed and stretched his arm, finding only the mattress.
He slowly opened his eyes and looked in the half-light of his bedroom.

The small clock on the chimney mantle rang three in hte morning, and the Lord sat up, looking for Katya.
He saw the thin silouhette looking out the window, draped with a bed sheet, her short heair framing her face widly.
He got out of the bed and approached her to embrace her tenderly.
The Malfoy manor gardens were shining under the pale light pf the moon.

"You're not sleeping?"

"I can't..."

"You're worried."

A simple fact, calmly said.

"It's been a week, Lucius."

"Sergei would have told you if something was up," the Lord whispered, putting his head on Katya's thin hair.
The young woman had refused the vampire's offer to inform her of Vladmir's progress.
She only asked him to calm him down before he killed Black.
Since then, Vlad never told her anything, and Katya regretted her decision.

"The trial..."

"He will be there tomorrow, I'm sure of it," Lucius consoled her.

"It's..."

"Is it the first time he disappears without giving you news?"

"Above all, I worry he kills Black, despite Sergei's presence."

"I do not think he will.
I read Dolohov's and Fedovir's autopsy reports.
It was nothing compared to what he planned for Black, wasn't it?"

"Probably...
I should never have accepted him hunting Black," Katya repeated.
"In hindsight, I fear the worst if Sergei gets between him and his plans."

"How so?"

"You never really saw Vladmir angry.
Really angry," Katya added, feeling her lover's surprise, who remembered the stories that his son told him about his friend's rare fits of rage in Hogwarts.

<hr>

And Vlamdir was angry indeed...
Hundred of kilometers away, he was carefully watching the Dursley home.
Why would Balck come here?
Why could he not be located, even with Dark magic?
Why had Katya told him to get him back to Kemenov palace without harming him?"

He groaned in frustration, sitting on the low wall of 4 Privet Drive, and looked at the shadows, amplified by the artificial lights of the street lamps.
Merlin, how those identical houses were terrible!

Sergei stepped out of the shadows again and sat down on the wall himself.

**"Missed again,"** the vampire noted.

**"THe tracker found him magical signature here.
But why here?"**

**"Maybe he knows you should have been given to the Dursleys' custody after your parents' death."**

**"How would he know?"**

**"I don't know about that, Kitten..."**

Vladmir swore again before lying down on the wall to look at the sky, then sighed.
Because of all the lights, he was unable to see any star.
He swore again and closed his eyes.

Suddenly, a strange horned animal appeared, glowing with a strong silvery shine, and bowed before them.
Vladmir opened an eyed when he felt the magical presence.

**"Knyaz Pokhastovine, your presence is immediately required in the Catacombs.
Immediately in the Catacombs..."**

The feminine voice faded with the animal.

**"Was that Steca's ibex?"** Vladmir whispered, leaning on an elbow.

**"What has she done this time?"** Sergei sighed, standing up.

Vlamdir smiled, thinking about Sergei's vampire lieutenant.
Completely crazy, continually wearing Muggle clothes, her hair usually dyed in bloody red with white strands, Steva Pokhastovine was a phenomenon.
However, despite her eccentricities, her talent for finding information was second to none.

**"You..."**

**"Go see her.
She never calls without a reason."**

Sergei carefully looked at the young Kemenov heir.
He tought he should not leave him alone in the middle of the night when he was tracking a man.
Despite Katya's request, he was not sure Vladmir would hold back if he found himself in front of Sirius Black.
He could see rage burning on the emeral green eyes of his little lord.

VLamdir, knowing the vampire's worries, promised he would quickly go back to the magical London and wait for him in the Leaky Cauldron.

**"However, if you're not there at seven,"** Vladmir said as the vampire was about to leave, **"I continue the search."**

**"What about the trial?"**

**"It starts at two.
Be on time, or Katya will not have her safeguard."**

Sergei observed Vladmir's determined gaze.
Obviously, he had reasons to follow him everywhere.
Not to protect him, but to protect others from him, Black especially...
He cursed the Potters' and Kemenovs' obstination before leaving.

Vladmir looked at the empty alleyway for a few seconds, before slowly turning his head towards the vegetation that surrounded a park.
He slowly stood up from the wall and rose his wand.

"Get out of there, Black," he declared coldly, his eyes shining with hate.

Only silence answered, and his face became expressionless as he slowly approached the park shrouded in darkness.

"You don't want to play hide and seek with be, you traitor," the Russian whispered.
"I don't know why Katya wants you alive, but if you don't show yourself immediately, I don't guarantee you'll stay safe and sound."

Leaves rustled in response.

_"Lumos."_

Vlamdir had time to see a massive canine silouhette, before it started to run away.
In surprise, Vlad lost a few precious seconds before reacting.

**"Slash!"**

The deep blue spell flew through the undergrowth and a painful yelp rang out.
Vladmir pushed away the branches and swore as he hear the snap of Disapparition.
He ragefully stared at the pool of blood on the ground and cursed as he crouched.

**"Animagus..."**

Vlad stayed immobile for a few seconds, then he Summoned a small glass vial to sample blood.
So Sirius Black was an undeclared Animagus.
This explained how hard it had been to locate him until then.
In his animal form, his magical signature changed.
Slightly, but enough to fool all the tracking spells in the world, whatever the type of magic used...
Vladmir lightly swirled the vial and a mean smile stretched his lips.

If the blood was Black's in his animal form, he could not avoid capture...

Vladmir stood up and got on the street, shook is wand and calmly got onto the magical bus that just appeared.
He did not see the man's grey eyes follow him, hurt as he somehow compressed the deep cut on his arm.

"Harry... why?"

Vladmir ignored the usual spiel of the Knight Bus conductor and gave him the amount for a one-way ticket to the Leaky Cauldron, London.
He also ignored all of Stan Shunpike's questions on his name, why he was in the streets so early.
He eventually understood that Vlad would not answer when the Russian looked daggers at him.

Vladmir had the satisfaction of seeing the man gulp, definitely afraid, before he left him alone.
He could thus settle down on a bed and, barefy feeling the violent shaking of the Knight Bus, he finally let his mind wander.

One week...
One week since they started the chase, going to all the places here Sirius Black's magical signature was detected through his Tracker.
The Dark Magic spell was formidably effective, but keeping it active for days on end was exhausting.
Vladmir had thus walked through all of Godric's Hollow, furious at the discovery that the traitor had visited his parents' graves, then Knockturn Alley, Liveppol, Derbyshire...
Until they went to this depressing Muggle place called Little Whinging in Surrey.

And he had let him go...
Vladmir put his head on the dubiously dirty windows of the Knight Bus and looked at the outside flying past them at tremendous speed.
He listened to the incessant babbling of the shrunken head, a thin smile on his lips.
How many wizards knew that this small head to send the infamous Ernie and Stan to Azkaban?
This type of charm was not so Light...
After all, it needed a fresh corpse's head, before it was drained of all matter sage a few layers of skin...
The Russian wondered if he could give his traitor of a godfather the same treatment.
He would be a perfect addition to the Kemenov palace trophee room...

The only good thing of this night's hunt was the discovery of Black's Animagus form.
A bloody dog...
Vlad understood the names that his father gave him in the memories he could watch, as well as the many canine veiled references his friends used when talking about this man...

As the sky was starting to light up, Vlad noticed that the housing density was starting to increase, and he held onto a bar, anticipating a rough stop.
And Ernie did not miss the occasion to be rough.
In a brutal skid, the Knight Bus stopped in front of a seedy bar, and the doors opened.

"Arrival at the Leaky Cauldron at 5:37.
Have a good day sir!"

Vlamdir looked at the streatched out hand of the conductor, and noticed his supplicant look.

"You should hide that little head, Stan," Vladmir said coldly.
"It would be regrettable if your income disappeared because of the presence of a category 3 magical object, would it not?"

And Vladmir left him to go to the Leaky Cauldron.
He barely went through the pub's door when he heard a chimney activate.
He cautiously put his hand on his wand and frowned when he saw Cornelius Fudge apprear, escorted by Alastor Moody and the black Auor that he had seen in Knockturn Alley and in Hogwarts before.

"Mister Kemenov!
What a relief that..."

Vladmir ignored him and approached the innkeeper.
The man quickly recognised him and gave him a toothless smile.

"Mr. Kemenov, the usual, I suppose?"

"Indeed Tom."

He took the kee, noticing the familiar number, and payed in cash.
The inn had become his base a week earlier.
Every day, he came in more or less random times and took a room for six hours, just enough to sleep, wash, and eat before leaving.

"Lord Potter, you..."

"What do you want Minister?" Vladmir groaned, finally deigning talking to the British Minister for Magic, who was disturbed by his behaviour.
Vlad briefly wondered if he would have a stroke in the middle of the Leaky Cauldron, jusding by his redness, the sweat that trickled on his temples, and the slight trembling of his body.

"I... we... the wizarding world... we..."

"You?" the Russian ironically encouraged him, making the British Minister shrivel a bit more.
**"Chicken,""** he added.

Moody hit a small laugh in a caughing fir, and Vladmir raised an eyebrow.
Did the Auror understand Russian?

During this short time, Cornelius Fudge realised he was the focus of the attention of the usual patrons of the Leaky Cauldron.
At this early hour, the first customers were starting to arrive.

"I was worried for your safety Mister Kemenov."

"That is why you put an alarm on the door of the Leaky Cauldron..." Vladmir noted, squinting his eyes, while whispers were starting to spread through the rare clients.
"It is an illegal measure when no inquiry was started on myself, Minister.
You are abusing your power."

"I... It's... You..."

"Admittedly... You? I?"

Some laughed openly, as the two Aurors visibly held back a smile they shouldn't show while they served as the Minister's bodyguards.
Laughing about your boss was never a good idea.

"You are in danger."

"You did not reveal any new information, Minister.
Now, if you'll excuse me, I wish to rest."

"You do not understand!
Sirius Black is looking for you!" the small man exclaimed.
"You are in danger!"

Vladmir turned back to face Fudge and coldly looked at him.
Then is calmly rolled up his right sleeve to show a large scar on his whole arm.

"I am the heir to the Kemenov Clan, Minister, one of the most influential clans in Russia.
I am always in danger.
This is a souvenir of the duel that happened in Hogwarts' premices.
Your Aurors were present, because if was official.
This," Vladmir said, pointing at another scar on the collar bone he had just revealed, "is a little thanks from an enemy clan when they attacked the Kemenov home, and this..."

Hushed whispers rang out when Vladmir revealed a slash that was still pink next to his heart.

"This, is the last one yet, Minister.
A good old English curse, because of which I owe my life to an excellent friend."

Vlamdir noticed that Moody's magical eye was staying on the wound, probably because he could feel the Dark Magic that was still oozing out, even months afterwards.

"The red breath..." the Auror whispered.

"Exactly," Vlamdir agreed, lowering his shirt.
"I am constantly the target of attacks, Minister.
I am not afraid of a man weakened by twelve years in prison."

And Vlamdir simply left the Minister to go rest.
He was tired and this stupid Minister had given him a headache...
He pushed the door of his lair and smiled.
He like that particular room.
It was comfortable and clean enough the window had a good view on Diagon Alley.
Vladmir stretched and took off his cape, then his shirt, slowly brushing the large slash on his chest.

The ones responsible for the curst were all dead, but he did not know what triggered it, which had Rasputing worried.
According to him, some magical threads were not taken out, as they were too close to his heart.
He had been too weak for the Dark Mage to risk his life.
A relapse could happen, but they had no idea what the main factor was...

Suddenly, Vladmir tensed up and took his wand and a dagger in one motion before turning to the door.
A few seconds before, someone knocked on the door.
Who was it?
Sergei would never have gone through the door.
Too risky, and not fun enough.
He preferred the window, or the chimney...

"Mr. Kemenov, I know you are here.
Please open, I just wish to talk."

This time, Vladmir frowned when he recognised the voice and cast a spell on the door.
It took an iridescent aspect and the silhouettes of the two Aurors could be seen clearly.

Vlad's anger rose, and his put his dagger in the sheath behind his belt, generally hidden by his cape, before getting to the door.

"What no?" he groaned, pointing his wand on Alastor Moddy's nearly inexistant nose.

"Constant vigilence!" the Auror roared out in laughtedr, while VLamdir squinted his eyes.
"The Minister is worried, but between both of your wands and your knives, I doubt anyone can hurt you."

"Two? hummm!"

"Do that once more, Auror Moody, and I will enuclate your remaining eye," Vlamdir whispered.
He could not bear to see his secrets revealed in an unsecure place, and the Leaky Cauldron corridor was definitely not secure.

"Enucleate?
That's one big word boy.
Something tells me you are familiar with surgical words," the Auror smiled, as his colleague was fulminating, muted by Vladmir and was expressing himself with large movements.
Vlad understood that he could not get rid of those two easily and motioned them to enter.

"What do you want?"

"Could you?" Moody started, pointing his head towards his colleague.
"Thank you.
Let me introduce you to Kingsley Shacklebot, and I believe you know who I am."

Vladmir simply nodded and leaned against the closest wall, his weapon still on him.

"How have you been since the last time?" the oldest Auror started in a playful voice.
"I hope this curse did not weaken you too much.
It has been so long since its last use that nobody remembers the exact price to pay."

"Alastor..."

"It's the Knockturn Alley kid," Moody calmly explained.
The black Auror's hand jumped, but he took a spell and opened his eyes wide when he saw his wand in the young Russian's hands.

"Harry Potter...
Or rather Vlamdir Kemenov.
I would like to understand how the son of such a great family can stink so much of Dark Magic."

"Stink?
Such a negative term that shows how narrow-minded you are," Vladmir retorted.
"Magic is neither Dark not Light, and only its use matters."

"So casting a curse in the middle of London is not Dark?"

"What curse?" Vlamdir asked with a surprised and innocent look on his face, which made both Aurors grimace.

"Since you threaten us with your weapons, your face is not really well matched with the rest," Shacklebot said.

"Now he's talking!" Vlamdir ironically gasped in admiration.
"One more time...
What do you want?"

"I wanted to check if my gut feeling was right.
The one I thought was your mother is Katya Kemenov, isn't she?"

Vladmir did not answer and Alastor Moody finally took the time to look at the kid.
Albus Dumbledore was both fascinated and terrified by this child.
An unhealthy obsession in his opinion, while his fear was understandable.
James and Lily Potter's son's charisma was incredible.
He guess that the young Kemenov normally kept it hidden, but he radiated power and confidence...
As well as Dark magic.

"You know your aunt and your best friend's father have an affair?
Lucius Malfoy is a known Death Eater, she should..."

"Why are you trying to involve yourself in the private life of the Kemenov matriarch and Lord Malfoy?"

Alastor tilted his head.
Alright, he would not talk about the aunt.
The kid had just heavily insisted on the titles, reminding them that they ought not to make enemies of him, as he belonged to a powerful family, with powerful allies.

He barely had time to react before a spell flew past him.
Auror Shacklebot did not have this chance, and was hit squar on by another spell.

"What's your problem kid?" Alastor groaned.
He did not get his wand out, however.
He was not there to fight, and he slowly moved to his colleague.
Stunned.

"I have warned you.
Last chance.
What... do... you... want?"

"I have two questions.
Why kill Darerine, Dolohov, and Fedovir?
I swear on my magic that I will not denounce you."

"Nobody attacks a member of clan Kemenov, nor the memory of the dead.
They were in England, so we struck in England," Vlad let out, after he saw Shacklebot begrudgingly imitate Moody.

The old Auror inaudibly swore.
The infamous Russian clan wars...
Not that he missed the deads; two Death Eaters and one of their accomplices were mere vermin.
However, it was a one less notch on the Aurors' belts.
It felt that they would be unsolved murders.

"Why did you not inform your superiors of my presence?"

"You still are Harry Potter, the Boy-Who-Lived, even with another name.
Plus, I personally don't consider the death of three Dark Mages worthy of grief."

A strange smile stretched Vladmir's lips.

"I am a Dark Mage myself.
Accord to the old names, of course."

Alastor Moddy thought he was about to faint.

"A curse like..."

"It would not have been possible for an average wizard," Vladmir agreed.
"And I do not consider my birth name is a valid reason."

"You reek of Dark Magic," Moody explained, smiling, staring at Vladmir's glacial gaze.
"However, I have quite the instinct, kid.
And it's screaming at me that you are untouchable.
The rare times I did not listen to it, bad things happened."

"What is your second question?"

"Could you... cancel the trial?"

Vladmir squinted, and Moody did not have time to react.
He got hit by the spell cast by both wands simultaneously and painfully hit the wall, before getting tied up.

"Dumbledore will pay for his criems, Auror Moody.
Do not think I will ever help you save this bloody manipulator!"

Alastor opened his eyes wide when a wand was pointed towards his forehead, and he sighed at himself for falling for it hook, line and sinker.

<hr>

He was still fulminating as he was in the stands of Audience room 7 of the Wizengamot.
To be found unconscious in fron the the entry of the Ministry had put a dent in his and his colleague's prides.
What could they say?
'We were had by a thirteen-year-old'?

They had taken the time to attent the trial outside of working hours, to try and help their leader and friend.
Although Alaster and numerous former members of the Order of the Phoenix had started to doubt Dumbledore for some time, he was still an emblematic character, and the leader of the Light...

Moody swore to himself when he saw the kid enter the room and gaze at him, smiling.
He never saw Katya Kemenov, and her ressemblence to James Potter hit him hard.

His heart ached, as he saw James and Sirirus Black continue their pranks in the Auror Preparation School.
This woman was the spitting image of her brother...

He grimaced a bit when Lucius Malfoy approached them, then, strangely, Augusta Longbottom.
He noted that Vladmir was walking towards a group of youngsters with serious faces, probably all Pure-Bloods, judging by their bearing and their dark but elegant outfits.
He recognised the Malfoy and Longbottom sons-- this association gave him weird shivers, whatver the generation-- then, to his great suprise, Arthur Weasley's twins approached them and started to talk in a low voice.

"Ladies, Gentlemen...
Please take place, the session will start in a few minues."

Alaster was astounded to see two of these Pure-Bloods go towards the witness benches, where several families of Muggle-Born students were sitting.
The young girl with an appeasing aura and the boy who oozed gentle strength were Muggle-Borns?

"Kevin Entwhisle and Hermione Granger, Ravenclaw and Gryffindor, both Muggle-Born, although they don't seem like it.
They were presented during the Malfoys' ball."

Alastor jumped, before smiling at the woman who interrupted his thoughts.

"Hi Minnie!
How did you know what I was thinking?"

"I simply followed your gaze Aly," Minerva McGonagall laughed in response.

The Auror made some room to let his old friend and the Hogwarts Transfirguration Professor sit down next to him.
Once she put away her severe teaching robes and her bun, she looked twenty years younger, especially if she smiled.

"You're not a witness?"

"No, Albus hid too many things from to for me to be able to defend him objectively," Minerva sighed, pinching her lips.
She pushed a strand of gray hair behind her ear, her attention on the Kemenovs.

"So that's them..." Moody eventually whispered.

"Huh?"

"Rumous said that Lucius Malfoy presented four children at the last Saturnalia, including Muggle-Borns.
The Pure-Bloods there confirmed nothing, and the press thought that it was a bad joke trying to stain the Malofys' reputation."

"Not at all, Auror Moody.
Professor McGonagall..."

"Mr. Malfoy," they both greeted him back.

"I have no regret to have presented Ms. Granger and Mr. Entwhistle during the Winter Solstice ball.
They are both perfectly aware of our traditions and are the perfect example of what Muggle-Born wizarding education should be."

And Lucius Malfoy left them on those last words to get to his Lord seat, as the old Auror was speechless.
Minerva, while she thought about the Pure-Blood's words, looked around her.
Nobody was looking at them.

"Do you think Albus will be dismissed from his responsibilities?" she asked, worried.
She did not see the thoughtful emerald green eyes on her.

**"What are you thinking about, Kitten?"**

**"I'm woundering what the old McGo is saying."**

**"Have some respect for your elders, young man,"** Sergei whispered, listening carefully or the Kemenovs.
**"The Auror is convinced Bubus is done, and the cat is afraid."**

**"Stop with this knickname,"** Katya whispered, before mumbling to herself that she thought she had two children.

**"We have a bet in the Palace,"** Sergei said with a smile.

Katya closed her eyes, wondering what her guards had made into a bet this time.
The latest closed one about Hogwarts was about the time before Vladmir had to spend time in the Hospital Wing.
She had won by betting on one year.
She was the closest, all the other ones thought it would have happened earlier.
There was also the one on the House of the Heir, the one on the possibility they played Quidditch, or that he ended up attacked by the Basilisk...
In short, the Kemenov clan was happily betting.
And Vlad generally got richer.

**"What bet?"** she finally asked, curious.

Sergei leaned towards her, so that only Katya could hear.

**"Will Vlad call him Bubus in front of the entire Wizengamot?"**

Katya rolled her eyes, sighing deeply.
She regretted not having her wand, not able to cast some sense into her right-hand man, as they were taken before entering...
And she could feel Vladmir's nervousness, even if he did not show it.
He could not stand being disarmed.

The young Russian felt his robe around and felt the characteristic shape of a dagger that had escaped controls thanks to advanced camouflage spells, before looking around.
Contrary to the first trial, which was a private matter and thus in camera, this second one was public, and many journalists and curious people were present.

All Wizengamot members were there, apart from Dumbledore.
Vladmir had delegated his vote to Damocles Rowle, and he did not understand why, like last year, Dumbledore was not represented.
It was unjust, but if a member of the Winzengamot could not be present, he could give a proxy vote, even as the accused.
It was one of the advantages of being an old family, which Vlamdir had immediately used.

He discreetly nodded to Amelia Bones, Theodore Nott, and Severus Prince, who sat for his first time, before looking over the other ones.
Apart from several parents of Hogwarts students, he recognised the three representatives of the International Confederation of Wizards from the previous time.
As well as the five membres of the Hogwarts Board of Governors who did not have a seat at the Wizengamot.
That was interesting...

Vlamdir leaned towards Sergei and whispered a few words in his ear.
The vampired looked at the old wizards of the Board of Governors, and shook his head.

**"Non, it's probably already decided."**

Vlamdir shrugged and went back to his contemplation.
The clerks, the three counsels, the twenty or so witnesses...
That was a lot of people.

Amelia Bones rose up and hit her gavel three times.
All fell silent, apart from the flashes of a few journalists taking photos.

"Today, we will cover the complaint filed by Katya Annapovna Kemenov against the Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, and its Headmaster, Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore, as well as the associated complaints.
The defendants are indicted for endangerment of boarded students, agravated negligence due to the Muggle origin of the plaintiffs, as well as breach of trust.
Members of the tribunal, the complaints have been reported in the dossiers that were given to you."

Papers ruffled, as the members of the Wizengamot looked over the documents.

"Secondary complaints, treated simultenaously as made possible by article 178.2 of the Penal Procedure Code, concern the Kemenov, Finch-Fletchley, Entwhistle, and Crivey families.
They bring a civil case against Hogwarts.
Finally, Hogwarts brings a civil case against Albus Dumbledore."

Stunned whispers could be heard, until Amelia Bones asked for silence.
It was exceptional to see an institution publicly bring a case against its representatives as publicly.

"Clerk, please take note.
Mister Bulbragon, the floor is yours for your opening statement."

"Thank you Judge Bones," the Kemenov's lawyer declared, representing the other plaintiffs as well, moving to the center of the room.
"Ladies, Lords, gentlemen...
I am sure most of you have either children or family members studying in Hogwarts.
You yourselves certainly graduated from that prestigious school.
For seven years, Hogwarts is a welcoming home for our children.
They learn magic, of course, as well as how to be a part of society, friendship, love...
It is a world of discovery and adaptation.
Hogwarts is a second home.
We are all interested in safeguarding it to make sure the future generations will live the most beautiful years.
It is thus to save our home that we are gathered today.

"Albus Dumbledore became Headmaster in 1956.
He has led the school admirably well for nearly the last forty years.
However, the last two years brought dangers over the future of the Magical world!
Indeed Ladies, Lords and gentlemen.
You heard me right: the future of the magical world.
That is what the students of this wonderful world are.
The future!

"'What dangers?' you might ask!
Lord Lovegood.
Lord Malfoy.
Lord Diggory.
Lady Longbottom.
I dare say you have family members currently enrolled at the school."

All four slowly nodded as whispers rose.
The lawyer had purposely families emblematic to each house and known for ther political weight.

"What do you respond if I say... 'prejudice'?"

"Objection, leading the jury!" both the School's and Dumbeldore's lawyers yelled.

"Sustained.
Mr Bulbragon, you are only allowed to ask the public."

"It will be enough your Honour.
Let's say..."
The plaintiff's lawyer took the time to think about it, then an amused smile stretched his lips.

"Let's say Mister Frederic Weasley, Mister Lovegood, Madam Sprout, and for Slytherin... Mister Greengrass.
What can you tell me about prejudice?"

"Gryffindor and Slytherin," Fred Weasley immediately answered.

"Can you tell me more about that?"

"Objection, leading question!" Hogwarts' lawyer intervened.

"Overruled.
Mister Weasley, are you aware that by answering this question, you become a witness?"

"I am, Minister."

A short-lived halo surrounded the redhead at the unspoken magical oath and Fred sat up.

"Nearly universally, Gryffindors hate Slytherins, while Slytherins hate us back."

"Can you say why?"

"I have no idea, sir.
A rumour says that Slytherins are all Dark Mages and Death Eaters.
It is repeated to us all the time since our first year, and it brings many dissensions, insults, among other pleasant things.
Every one who studied in Hogwarts know what I am talking about."

Many people nodded in the public, even among the Wizengamot, while Dumbledore was whispering with his lawyer.

"What do you say about this, Mister Greengrass, as a former Slytherin student?" Bulbragon called out to him.

The man stood up and the same magical halo surrounded him, as a witness.

"Mister Weasley summarised the situation well.
For us Slytherins, Gryffindors are immature idiots, incaoable of thought.
They spend their time discriminating and belitteling us.
'Snake', 'budding Death-Eater'...
We hear insults daily, and often respond to them indeirectly."

"Ladies, Lords and gentlement, please note the use of 'rumour says' from Mr. Weasley and 'Gryffindors are' from Mr. Greengrass.
Madam Sprout, Mister Lovegood, what do you think about those declarations?"

"They are unfortunately exact," Professor Sprout sighed, the Quibbler's director nodding along.
"Hufflepuffs are considered weak and suffer mockery..."

The short pudgy woman fell silent, sadness visible on her face.

"We send our children in a school so that they learn life within our society, tolerance, self and mutual respect.
Houses were created in order to create a sane competition.
However, the analysis is upsetting!
Hate!
Prejudice!
Contempt!" the lawyer enunciated.
"What has the Headmaster done to mitigate this?
He has scheduled lessons between enely Houses as much as possible.
For forty years, three quarters of the lessons between Slytherin and another House has been with Gryffindor.
For forty years, this has only amplified scorn between the two Houses.
Why did he not think of another solution?
Prejudice, therefore detrimental competition!
You will find within this vial some interesting discussions between Hogwarts students.
I ask that oly the jury is shown this evidence to protect the students' anonymity.
Because of those facts, I ask for Albus Dumbledore's immediate resignation as Headmaster of Hogwarts."

"The Court notes your grievances, and will watch the memories in camera," Amelia Bones declared, sending a clerk to collect the vial.
"Please continue."

"Thank you Judge Bones.
I will now come to the negligence question, strongly correlated to the partiality problems I talked about previously.
This passed school year saw several accidents happen.
Three Muggle-Born students were petrified.
We will see the cause lated," the lawyer eluded before questions were asked.
"The solution to free them was straightforward: a Mandrake Restorative Draught.
One vial trades for 23 Galleons at most apothecaries.
For the Muggles present, this is around 120 British pounds.
It is an expensive potion, but quite ridiculous compared to the tuition.
However, Professor Dumbledore refused Madam Pomfrey's proposition as Hogwarts' Matron and renown Mediwitch!
He argued that Hogwarts had always prepared all its healing potions and that they had an more than competant Potions Master.
I do not doubt Lord Prince's talenthis numerous creations greatly pushed knowledge forward, but I do doubt Professor Dumbledore's lack of will.
Madam Pomfrey, can you swear that all of the school's Potions come from Severus Prince's laboratory."

"No sir.
A dozen or so of our Potions are bought in, as they are extremely long and tedious to brew.
Severus...
Professor Prince does not have time to brew them during the school periods with his lessons, and his vacations are his own free time," the Matron declared with embarassement, looking at her Headmaster.

"Therefore the Headmaster's argument is refuted.
Professor Dumbledore, why did you refuse to buy this potion when you knew that Mr. Crivey, then Mr. Finch-Fletchey and Mr. Entwhistle would lose one full year of lessons?
You endangered those children's school years to save 69 Galleons."

"You..."

"Silence Mr. Dumbledore!" Lucius interfened, as the Headmaster had stood up, face purple in anger.
"Your time to speak has not come yet!
Please carry on Mr. Bulbragon, your talk is compelling."

"Thank you Lord Malfoy.
As i was saying, Mister Dumbledore has completely destroyed the school year for those children.
The parents would have payed for the potions themselves had they known of their existance.
However, they are all from the Muggle world, and thus have no knowledge of Mediwizardry, and the school never informed them.
A lie by ommission that shows the Headmaster's contempt for his students.
For the prejudice caused to the families and the students, I ask for 5000 Galleons each in damages!"

"We take not of your grievences," Cornelius Fudge declared.
"Please continue."

"Now for my last count of indictment.
I will leave the breach of trust count to my colleague Mister Owells, representing Hogwarts.
I will only focus on a problem that has been unacceptable for at least two years.
The school's safety.
Last year, the Philosopher's Stone was hidden in Hogwarts!
This year, a Basilisk spread terror in the school!
Why have the Board of Governors and parents of students never been informed of the dangers?"

"Please explain," Theodore Nott asked, as many whispers rose up and booing started towards the Headmaster.
"Are you talking about the mythical Philosopher's Stone?
And a Basilisk?"

The lawyer took the time to take a sip of water, satisfied to see the whole room hanging onto his every word once more, before pointing to the public's stands with a sardonic smile.

"Mister Flamel here will confirm that he put the Stone in his friend Albus Dumbledore's hands to safeguard it in Hogwarts."

Surprised cries rang out as a couple that had been ignored before was reapeatedly photogrpahed.
Nicolas Flamel and his wife had rarely gone out since the beginning of the previous century.
Their presence was extremely rare, and was bad news for Dumbledore.

"The Stone was guarded by a cerberus.
The same cerberus who was hidden in a corridor of the third floor.
What were the words again?
'The corridor of the third floor of East Wing is strictly forbidden, or you will die in atrocious circumstances'.
This is exactly what is needed to make curious students try to got there!
I will quickly pass over the Troll incident, Mister Malfoy had filed a complaint last year, and will only say that the Headmaster, knowing the creature was in the dungeons, sent the Slytherin students to their common room!
For those who do not know, their common room is precisely in the dungeons."

This time, angry cries rang out, and the lawyer patiently waited for the calm to come back, under threat of an adjourned trial.

"I think I needn't explain the dangers of having a Basilsik on the school, expecially one linked to the Heirs of Slytherin.
Heirs among whom was Tome Riddle.
Mister Dumbledore, for the endangerment of students, will will ask one more time for your immediate resignation, and would like to ask you another question..."

"Objection!" the Headmaster's lawyer yelled.

"Overruled," Damocles Rowle yelled back.
"Ask your question."

Alister Bulbragon turned to the old wizard and gave him a terrifying one, identical to the one on the lips of the Kemenov Clan membres.

"Professor...
Why did you never report the presence of Lord Voldemort in the school premises two years in a row?"

His words had quite the effect.

Screams of fear rang out as other yelled in denial.
The lawyer was booed and called a crazy liar, be he stayed stoic against the aggressions, waiting for the Wizengamot to intervene.

A recess was announced while the public was escorted out of the court room.
Eventually, only witnesses as well as the representatives from the ICW and two journalists could stay.
Vladmir and Kevin were the only Alliance students who stayed.

"Let's continue," Amelia Bones declared wearily.
"Mister Bulbragon, proof of your accusation were noted.
However, on what ground do you base your declaration of You-Know-Who's presence?
He died twelve years ago."

"He did not, Judge Bones.
Mister Kemenov?"

Vladmir stood up and carefully looked at the members of the jury.

"I met Voldemort once, this year."

"Would you testify under Veritaserum?" Dumbeldore's lawyer asked.

"I would."

"You note your acceptance.
Mister Owells, please come to the bar to represent Hogwarts."

The school's lawyer, a small and nervous man, approached.

"Judge Bones, Members of the Wizengamot.
I regretfully have to say that, contrary to my esteemed colleague, I will only do a short statement, and will avoid spectacular revelations."

Some discreet laughs could be heard responding the the lawyer's tentative humour.

"I will only touch two points.
The Hogwarts Board of Governors had full confidence in Albus Dumbeldore.
As Mister Bulbragon said, he has been Headmaster for forty years, and was fully competent until recently.
My clients admit that they had placed a misguided blind confidence in the Headmaster, which resulted in disastrous results.
Measures were taken.
Albus Dumbledore's removal from Hogwarts teaching staff has already been notified, and a new article in the Charter ensures that an audit of the entire staff will be conducted for the start of the school year, and every five years afterwards."

Vlamdir softly chuckled as he noticed the suddenly pale face of the former Headmaster.
Apparently, he has not been informed of his sacking.
Judging by Lucius's smile, he has something to do in this decision...
And Dumbledore's lawyer's pensive face was quite the good omen...

"Hogwarts is at fault, passively, we admit it," Mister Owells continued, "and for this we accuse Albus Dumbledore of breach of trust and reckless endangerment.
We demand for 10 years imprisonment, as well as damages amounting for 10,000 Galleons, which will be used to create a new subject and hire a Professor of Wizard Studies."

"Your grievances have been noted.
Mister Copfield, counsel for the Defence, please give your opening statement," Judge Bones declared coldly.

Dumbeldore's lawyer stood up, perturbed by the sudden declaration from the Board of Governors, then said the most unexcpected thing.

"I refuse to defend Mister Dumbledore."

The journalists opened their eyes wide, astounded by what they heard, as was the rest of the room.

"I... I beg your pardon?" Amelia Bones stuttered.

"I am a Sltyherin, Madam.
Contrary to prejudice, I hate You-Know-Who.
Knowing that my former client never advice the authorities, consciously lied, and endangered hundreds of children, and the magical world in general...
I have some ethics, Judge Bones, and I refuse to defend this man!"

"You-Know-Who's survival has not yet been established," Lady Longbottom reminded him.

"If Mister Kemenov accepts Veritaserum, it's the best of proofs for me."

"Very well, Mister Copfields...
I will then invite you to the public stands," Lady Bones declared, still shocked.

Whispers among the distinguished members of wizarding justice and the public continued for a few minutes, then Cornelius Fudge asked Dumbeldore to present his defence.
Unfortunately for him, it was minimal.
The sudden defectio from his lawyer had visibly shaken him, and he somehow still tried to justify his actions.
Knowing that he still believed after forty years in a possible friednship between the Houses made many people laugh.
Knowing that he had refused to buy the potion for the petrified students because of a lack of funds had enraged the members of the Board of Governors.
Only his protest about the Basilisk seemed coherent.

"A Basilisk kills, it does not petrify!
How could I have known that this magical creature was roaming the school?"

"Thank you...
You can sit down, Mister Dumbledore.
We will see the evidence, then it will be time for questions."

The audience went to recess for an hour, in order to show the Wizengamot all the evidence, then the trial continued.

"We will start with the accusations over safety.
Mister Flamel, do you accept the use of Veritaserum?"

"I do, Judge Bones."

After having asked the jury and counsel the same question, Amelia Bones invited the alchemist to the bar, and a dose of Potion was administered under the attentive eye of a Mediwizard from St Mungo named Matthew McCallum.
After a few standard questions, the questioning began.

Nicolas Flamel confirmed the presence of the Philosopher's Stone in the school.
He certified that the Headmaster had asked him for the permission to study it.
They had worked together in the past, and he had wanted to restart his research.

"Where is the Stone now?"

"Someone stole it while he was supposed to safeguard it, and sent it to me, along with a memory showing that Voldemort tried to steal it.
The full memory shows me that Albus had put up a trap for the Dark Mage.
He lied to me, and I cut all relationships with him."

"Thank you Mister Flamel.
Mister Valvett, as a representative of the Board of Governors, did you know about the Stone's presence?"

The answer under Veritaserum was negative.
It was the same for the Basilisk.

"Did you at least know that students were petrified?" a member of the Wizengamot asked.

"We did, but did not know the reason.
Mister Dumbledore told us about a Gorgon, with Mister Lockhart's testimony."

On the witness bench, it was too much for Kevin, who laughed out loud mockingly, catching angry glances.
He stood up at the Wizengamot's request and explained why he was laughing.

"I am sorry, I deeply doubt the veracity of Mr. Lockhart's, or rather Marcus O'Balley's testimonial, especially since all of his exploits are stolen."

"How do you know that?" Lucius asked, holding back laughter despite his surprise.
The Irish Court would love this...

"Some sure source told me, and they will remain anonymous.
Mr. O'Balley confirmed it and tried to cast a Memory Charm on me afterwards."

"You escaped it?" Augusta Longbottom.
"You were in second year, and he was a professor!"

"I can run very fast," Kevin answered seriously, making some spectators laugh.
He repeated his declarations under Veritaserum, and an iquiry over the Profesor of Defense Against the Dark Arts was started.

"Let us go back to the subject at hand," Theodore Nott said.
"Mister Valveltt, what motivated the creation of this new subject?"

"Miss Hermione Granger's and Mister Kevin Entwhistle's integration in society.
They perfect knowledge of our world, which most of ous could see at Lord Malfoy's ball, showed us the importance of teaching our tradictions."

"What do you expect to do for the students and the prejudice?"

"We are thinking about creating study groups.
A student per House.
The group effect is one of the main problem, and having the students away from the Housemates a few hours could be beneficial.
We will start them next year," Valvett explained.

"What about the students who were hurt but their petrifaction?"

"Junstin Finch-Fletchley and Colin Crivey will be offered to repeat the previous year."

"I have a question for Mister Entwhistle: why did you regain consciousness earlier?"
According to the report, you were back in class three weeks after your attack."

"My best friend is also a rich person.
He ordered a vial and administered it to me somehow."

He did not really lie, and he gave no name, perfectly biasing the truth potion.
Then, when Vlamdir was called ingested the potion and stood up at the bar, the interesting part started.

"Indeed, I have fought against Lord Voldemort last year.
He took possession of a student."

"How did you know it was him?"

"He is a Parsletongue."

"Do you understand Parsletongue?"

"Kevin understand it," Vlamdir declared in a monotone voice.
"It's hot."

All who understood the truth opened their eyes wide, as Vlamdir did not answer a direct question under Veritaserum, while Wizengamot members were more worried about the last sentence.
