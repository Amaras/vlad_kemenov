## Chapter 35

Lucius sighed and stretched his arm, finding only the mattress.
He slowly opened his eyes and looked in the half-light of his bedroom.

The small clock on the chimney mantle rang three in hte morning, and the Lord sat up, looking for Katya.
He saw the thin silouhette looking out the window, draped with a bed sheet, her short heair framing her face widly.
He got out of the bed and approached her to embrace her tenderly.
The Malfoy manor gardens were shining under the pale light pf the moon.

"You're not sleeping?"

"I can't..."

"You're worried."

A simple fact, calmly said.

"It's been a week, Lucius."

"Sergei would have told you if something was up," the Lord whispered, putting his head on Katya's thin hair.
The young woman had refused the vampire's offer to inform her of Vladmir's progress.
She only asked him to calm him down before he killed Black.
Since then, Vlad never told her anything, and Katya regretted her decision.

"The trial..."

"He will be there tomorrow, I'm sure of it," Lucius consoled her.

"It's..."

"Is it the first time he disappears without giving you news?"

"Above all, I worry he kills Black, despite Sergei's presence."

"I do not think he will.
I read Dolohov's and Fedovir's autopsy reports.
It was nothing compared to what he planned for Black, wasn't it?"

"Probably...
I should never have accepted him hunting Black," Katya repeated.
"In hindsight, I fear the worst if Sergei gets between him and his plans."

"How so?"

"You never really saw Vladmir angry.
Really angry," Katya added, feeling her lover's surprise, who remembered the stories that his son told him about his friend's rare fits of rage in Hogwarts.

<hr>

And Vlamdir was angry indeed...
Hundred of kilometers away, he was carefully watching the Dursley home.
Why would Balck come here?
Why could he not be located, even with Dark magic?
Why had Katya told him to get him back to Kemenov palace without harming him?"

He groaned in frustration, sitting on the low wall of 4 Privet Drive, and looked at the shadows, amplified by the artificial lights of the street lamps.
Merlin, how those identical houses were terrible!

Sergei stepped out of the shadows again and sat down on the wall himself.

**"Missed again,"** the vampire noted.

**"THe tracker found him magical signature here.
But why here?"**

**"Maybe he knows you should have been given to the Dursleys' custody after your parents' death."**

**"How would he know?"**

**"I don't know about that, Kitten..."**

Vladmir swore again before lying down on the wall to look at the sky, then sighed.
Because of all the lights, he was unable to see any star.
He swore again and closed his eyes.

Suddenly, a strange horned animal appeared, glowing with a strong silvery shine, and bowed before them.
Vladmir opened an eyed when he felt the magical presence.

**"Knyaz Pokhastovine, your presence is immediately required in the Catacombs.
Immediately in the Catacombs..."**

The feminine voice faded with the animal.

**"Was that Steca's ibex?"** Vladmir whispered, leaning on an elbow.

**"What has she done this time?"** Sergei sighed, standing up.

Vlamdir smiled, thinking about Sergei's vampire lieutenant.
Completely crazy, continually wearing Muggle clothes, her hair usually dyed in bloody red with white strands, Steva Pokhastovine was a phenomenon.
However, despite her eccentricities, her talent for finding information was second to none.

**"You..."**

**"Go see her.
She never calls without a reason."**

Sergei carefully looked at the young Kemenov heir.
He tought he should not leave him alone in the middle of the night when he was tracking a man.
Despite Katya's request, he was not sure Vladmir would hold back if he found himself in front of Sirius Black.
He could see rage burning on the emeral green eyes of his little lord.

VLamdir, knowing the vampire's worries, promised he would quickly go back to the magical London and wait for him in the Leaky Cauldron.

**"However, if you're not there at seven,"** Vladmir said as the vampire was about to leave, **"I continue the search."**

**"What about the trial?"**

**"It starts at two.
Be on time, or Katya will not have her safeguard."**

Sergei observed Vladmir's determined gaze.
Obviously, he had reasons to follow him everywhere.
Not to protect him, but to protect others from him, Black especially...
He cursed the Potters' and Kemenovs' obstination before leaving.

Vladmir looked at the empty alleyway for a few seconds, before slowly turning his head towards the vegetation that surrounded a park.
He slowly stood up from the wall and rose his wand.

"Get out of there, Black," he declared coldly, his eyes shining with hate.

Only silence answered, and his face became expressionless as he slowly approached the park shrouded in darkness.

"You don't want to play hide and seek with be, you traitor," the Russian whispered.
"I don't know why Katya wants you alive, but if you don't show yourself immediately, I don't guarantee you'll stay safe and sound."

Leaves rustled in response.

_"Lumos."_

Vlamdir had time to see a massive canine silouhette, before it started to run away.
In surprise, Vlad lost a few precious seconds before reacting.

**"Slash!"**

The deep blue spell flew through the undergrowth and a painful yelp rang out.
Vladmir pushed away the branches and swore as he hear the snap of Disapparition.
He ragefully stared at the pool of blood on the ground and cursed as he crouched.

**"Animagus..."**

Vlad stayed immobile for a few seconds, then he Summoned a small glass vial to sample blood.
So Sirius Black was an undeclared Animagus.
This explained how hard it had been to locate him until then.
In his animal form, his magical signature changed.
Slightly, but enough to fool all the tracking spells in the world, whatever the type of magic used...
Vladmir lightly swirled the vial and a mean smile stretched his lips.

If the blood was Black's in his animal form, he could not avoid capture...

Vladmir stood up and got on the street, shook is wand and calmly got onto the magical bus that just appeared.
He did not see the man's grey eyes follow him, hurt as he somehow compressed the deep cut on his arm.

"Harry... why?"

Vladmir ignored the usual spiel of the Knight Bus conductor and gave him the amount for a one-way ticket to the Leaky Cauldron, London.
He also ignored all of Stan Shunpike's questions on his name, why he was in the streets so early.
He eventually understood that Vlad would not answer when the Russian looked daggers at him.

Vladmir had the satisfaction of seeing the man gulp, definitely afraid, before he left him alone.
He could thus settle down on a bed and, barefy feeling the violent shaking of the Knight Bus, he finally let his mind wander.

One week...
One week since they started the chase, going to all the places here Sirius Black's magical signature was detected through his Tracker.
The Dark Magic spell was formidably effective, but keeping it active for days on end was exhausting.
Vladmir had thus walked through all of Godric's Hollow, furious at the discovery that the traitor had visited his parents' graves, then Knockturn Alley, Liveppol, Derbyshire...
Until they went to this depressing Muggle place called Little Whinging in Surrey.

And he had let him go...
Vladmir put his head on the dubiously dirty windows of the Knight Bus and looked at the outside flying past them at tremendous speed.
He listened to the incessant babbling of the shrunken head, a thin smile on his lips.
How many wizards knew that this small head to send the infamous Ernie and Stan to Azkaban?
This type of charm was not so Light...
After all, it needed a fresh corpse's head, before it was drained of all matter sage a few layers of skin...
The Russian wondered if he could give his traitor of a godfather the same treatment.
He would be a perfect addition to the Kemenov palace trophee room...

The only good thing of this night's hunt was the discovery of Black's Animagus form.
A bloody dog...
Vlad understood the names that his father gave him in the memories he could watch, as well as the many canine veiled references his friends used when talking about this man...

As the sky was starting to light up, Vlad noticed that the housing density was starting to increase, and he held onto a bar, anticipating a rough stop.
And Ernie did not miss the occasion to be rough.
In a brutal skid, the Knight Bus stopped in front of a seedy bar, and the doors opened.

"Arrival at the Leaky Cauldron at 5:37.
Have a good day sir!"

Vlamdir looked at the streatched out hand of the conductor, and noticed his supplicant look.

"You should hide that little head, Stan," Vladmir said coldly.
"It would be regrettable if your income disappeared because of the presence of a category 3 magical object, would it not?"

And Vladmir left him to go to the Leaky Cauldron.
He barely went through the pub's door when he heard a chimney activate.
He cautiously put his hand on his wand and frowned when he saw Cornelius Fudge apprear, escorted by Alastor Moody and the black Auor that he had seen in Knockturn Alley and in Hogwarts before.

"Mister Kemenov!
What a relief that..."

Vladmir ignored him and approached the innkeeper.
The man quickly recognised him and gave him a toothless smile.

"Mr. Kemenov, the usual, I suppose?"

"Indeed Tom."

He took the kee, noticing the familiar number, and payed in cash.
The inn had become his base a week earlier.
Every day, he came in more or less random times and took a room for six hours, just enough to sleep, wash, and eat before leaving.

"Lord Potter, you..."

"What do you want Minister?" Vladmir groaned, finally deigning talking to the British Minister for Magic, who was disturbed by his behaviour.
Vlad briefly wondered if he would have a stroke in the middle of the Leaky Cauldron, jusding by his redness, the sweat that trickled on his temples, and the slight trembling of his body.

"I... we... the wizarding world... we..."

"You?" the Russian ironically encouraged him, making the British Minister shrivel a bit more.
**"Chicken,""** he added.

Moody hit a small laugh in a caughing fir, and Vladmir raised an eyebrow.
Did the Auror understand Russian?

During this short time, Cornelius Fudge realised he was the focus of the attention of the usual patrons of the Leaky Cauldron.
At this early hour, the first customers were starting to arrive.

"I was worried for your safety Mister Kemenov."

"That is why you put an alarm on the door of the Leaky Cauldron..." Vladmir noted, squinting his eyes, while whispers were starting to spread through the rare clients.
"It is an illegal measure when no inquiry was started on myself, Minister.
You are abusing your power."

"I... It's... You..."

"Admittedly... You? I?"

Some laughed openly, as the two Aurors visibly held back a smile they shouldn't show while they served as the Minister's bodyguards.
Laughing about your boss was never a good idea.

"You are in danger."

"You did not reveal any new information, Minister.
Now, if you'll excuse me, I wish to rest."

"You do not understand!
Sirius Black is looking for you!" the small man exclaimed.
"You are in danger!"

Vladmir turned back to face Fudge and coldly looked at him.
Then is calmly rolled up his right sleeve to show a large scar on his whole arm.

"I am the heir to the Kemenov Clan, Minister, one of the most influential clans in Russia.
I am always in danger.
This is a souvenir of the duel that happened in Hogwarts' premices.
Your Aurors were present, because if was official.
This," Vladmir said, pointing at another scar on the collar bone he had just revealed, "is a little thanks from an enemy clan when they attacked the Kemenov home, and this..."

Hushed whispers rang out when Vladmir revealed a slash that was still pink next to his heart.

"This, is the last one yet, Minister.
A good old English curse, because of which I owe my life to an excellent friend."

Vlamdir noticed that Moody's magical eye was staying on the wound, probably because he could feel the Dark Magic that was still oozing out, even months afterwards.

"The red breath..." the Auror whispered.

"Exactly," Vlamdir agreed, lowering his shirt.
"I am constantly the target of attacks, Minister.
I am not afraid of a man weakened by twelve years in prison."

And Vlamdir simply left the Minister to go rest.
He was tired and this stupid Minister had given him a headache...
He pushed the door of his lair and smiled.
He like that particular room.
It was comfortable and clean enough the window had a good view on Diagon Alley.
Vladmir stretched and took off his cape, then his shirt, slowly brushing the large slash on his chest.

The ones responsible for the curst were all dead, but he did not know what triggered it, which had Rasputing worried.
According to him, some magical threads were not taken out, as they were too close to his heart.
He had been too weak for the Dark Mage to risk his life.
A relapse could happen, but they had no idea what the main factor was...

Suddenly, Vladmir tensed up and took his wand and a dagger in one motion before turning to the door.
A few seconds before, someone knocked on the door.
Who was it?
Sergei would never have gone through the door.
Too risky, and not fun enough.
He preferred the window, or the chimney...

"Mr. Kemenov, I know you are here.
Please open, I just wish to talk."

This time, Vladmir frowned when he recognised the voice and cast a spell on the door.
It took an iridescent aspect and the silhouettes of the two Aurors could be seen clearly.

Vlad's anger rose, and his put his dagger in the sheath behind his belt, generally hidden by his cape, before getting to the door.

"What no?" he groaned, pointing his wand on Alastor Moddy's nearly inexistant nose.

"Constant vigilence!" the Auror roared out in laughtedr, while VLamdir squinted his eyes.
"The Minister is worried, but between both of your wands and your knives, I doubt anyone can hurt you."

"Two? hummm!"

"Do that once more, Auror Moody, and I will enuclate your remaining eye," Vlamdir whispered.
He could not bear to see his secrets revealed in an unsecure place, and the Leaky Cauldron corridor was definitely not secure.

"Enucleate?
That's one big word boy.
Something tells me you are familiar with surgical words," the Auror smiled, as his colleague was fulminating, muted by Vladmir and was expressing himself with large movements.
Vlad understood that he could not get rid of those two easily and motioned them to enter.

"What do you want?"

"Could you?" Moody started, pointing his head towards his colleague.
"Thank you.
Let me introduce you to Kingsley Shacklebot, and I believe you know who I am."

Vladmir simply nodded and leaned against the closest wall, his weapon still on him.

"How have you been since the last time?" the oldest Auror started in a playful voice.
"I hope this curse did not weaken you too much.
It has been so long since its last use that nobody remembers the exact price to pay."

"Alastor..."

"It's the Knockturn Alley kid," Moody calmly explained.
The black Auror's hand jumped, but he took a spell and opened his eyes wide when he saw his wand in the young Russian's hands.

"Harry Potter...
Or rather Vlamdir Kemenov.
I would like to understand how the son of such a great family can stink so much of Dark Magic."

"Stink?
Such a negative term that shows how narrow-minded you are," Vladmir retorted.
"Magic is neither Dark not Light, and only its use matters."

"So casting a curse in the middle of London is not Dark?"

"What curse?" Vlamdir asked with a surprised and innocent look on his face, which made both Aurors grimace.

"Since you threaten us with your weapons, your face is not really well matched with the rest," Shacklebot said.

"Now he's talking!" Vlamdir ironically gasped in admiration.
"One more time...
What do you want?"

"I wanted to check if my gut feeling was right.
The one I thought was your mother is Katya Kemenov, isn't she?"

Vladmir did not answer and Alastor Moody finally took the time to look at the kid.
Albus Dumbledore was both fascinated and terrified by this child.
