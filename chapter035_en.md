## Chapter 35

Lucius sighed and stretched his arm, finding only the mattress.
He slowly opened his eyes and looked in the half-light of his bedroom.

The small clock on the chimney mantle rang three in hte morning, and the Lord sat up, looking for Katya.
He saw the thin silouhette looking out the window, draped with a bed sheet, her short heair framing her face widly.
He got out of the bed and approached her to embrace her tenderly.
The Malfoy manor gardens were shining under the pale light pf the moon.

"You're not sleeping?"

"I can't..."

"You're worried."

A simple fact, calmly said.

"It's been a week, Lucius."

"Sergei would have told you if something was up," the Lord whispered, putting his head on Katya's thin hair.
The young woman had refused the vampire's offer to inform her of Vladmir's progress.
She only asked him to calm him down before he killed Black.
Since then, Vlad never told her anything, and Katya regretted her decision.

"The trial..."

"He will be there tomorrow, I'm sure of it," Lucius consoled her.

"It's..."

"Is it the first time he disappears without giving you news?"

"Above all, I worry he kills Black, despite Sergei's presence."

"I do not think he will.
I read Dolohov's and Fedovir's autopsy reports.
It was nothing compared to what he planned for Black, wasn't it?"

"Probably...
I should never have accepted him hunting Black," Katya repeated.
"In hindsight, I fear the worst if Sergei gets between him and his plans."

"How so?"

"You never really saw Vladmir angry.
Really angry," Katya added, feeling her lover's surprise, who remembered the stories that his son told him about his friend's rare fits of rage in Hogwarts.

<hr>

And Vlamdir was angry indeed...
Hundred of kilometers away, he was carefully watching the Dursley home.
Why would Balck come here?
Why could he not be located, even with Dark magic?
Why had Katya told him to get him back to Kemenov palace without harming him?"

He groaned in frustration, sitting on the low wall of 4 Privet Drive, and looked at the shadows, amplified by the artificial lights of the street lamps.
Merlin, how those identical houses were terrible!

Sergei stepped out of the shadows again and sat down on the wall himself.

**"Missed again,"** the vampire noted.

**"THe tracker found him magical signature here.
But why here?"**

**"Maybe he knows you should have been given to the Dursleys' custody after your parents' death."**

**"How would he know?"**

**"I don't know about that, Kitten..."**

Vladmir swore again before lying down on the wall to look at the sky, then sighed.
Because of all the lights, he was unable to see any star.
He swore again and closed his eyes.

Suddenly, a strange horned animal appeared, glowing with a strong silvery shine, and bowed before them.
Vladmir opened an eyed when he felt the magical presence.

**"Knyaz Pokhastovine, your presence is immediately required in the Catacombs.
Immediately in the Catacombs..."**

The feminine voice faded with the animal.

**"Was that Steca's ibex?"**
