# Chapter 45: Meetings between Magical Creatures

"I think it's the first time that we all take the Hogwarts Express together," Hermione noted, comfortably nestling against Draco.
The latter, to be more comfortable, put his arms around the young girl's waist, while pushing his rook on the chessboard on Hannah Abbott's lap.
His gesture made his friends smile mockingly, which Draco ignored in a typical Malfoy manner.

"Indeed, I have never seen you in the return train, Vladmir," Theodore declared while munching on a Chocolate Frog.
Luna Lovegood was half lying on him and Kevin, reading the Quibbler upside down, atrocious glasses on her nose.
It must be said that they were 12 in a compartment that was designed for half as many people.
Fortunately, they all knew how to charm their suitcases…

Compartment 5 of carriage 9 of the Hogwarts Express was overflowing, and yet the atmosphere was appeased, despite the mix of Houses.
The group project had done a wonderful job, and in one year, the relationships between the Houses were not seen as negatively.

"It's the first time I stay in Britain for the start of the holidays," the Russian explained calmly, sitting on the groups, looking at his cards and the game in front of him.
"All-in."

"It's not possible, you're cheating," Neville grumbled, leaning back onto Susan's legs, who blushed slightly, but did not protest.
Contrary to Hannah, who had been invited to come to their compartment and frankly blushed at the Longbottom Heir's brazenness, especially since he was supposed to be pathologically shy.
Daphne Greengrass mumbled that he had Leprechaun cards in his hands, and declared that she folded, while Blaise, smiling, simply called.

"You're going to lose," Cedric said, who had an unobstructed view of the Ravenclaw's flush.

"I doubt it," the Slythrin sniggered.

"What do you have Zabini?"

"Show your hand, Kemenov!"

"The future ruined one goes first!"

"Four aces!"

"Flush!" the Ravenclaw revealed with a satisfied smile.
"Here come the riches!"

With an ample gesture, he took the pile of Galleons that was on the ground between them.

"What are you doing?" an easily identifiable voice asked.

"We are playing cards, Professor," Vlamdir answered the Charms Professor with a smile.

The Goblin quinted his entirely black eyes, then smiled, revealing his teeth that were too sharp for a human.

"Then allow me to join you…"

Calmly, ignoring half of the compartment's astonishement as they had no idea of his implication with the Mirage Court, Filius Flitwick settled down between the second and third year students.
He invoked Leprechaun gold to play wiht an amused rictus, and preceeded to conscientiously fleece the four students.

$You are a true thief$, Vladmir grumbled, making their Charms Professor smile as he pocketed the true coins, for a total of 500 Galleons.

$No dear, I am a Goblin$.
"We'll be there in 15 minutes, be ready!"

And, with 500 Galleons more in his pocket, the Charms Professor got out as calmly as when he arrived, under the astounded smiles of every one.

"Did he just…"

"Make off with 500 Galleons?
Yeah, he did," Blaise mumbled.

"He did know they were real Galleons, didn't he Vlad?" Neville asked.

"Of course, he is a Goblin," Vladmir sighed.

"That's what I called being fleeced," Draco laughed.

"And as Vladmir declared that it was Leprechaun gold, you can't do anything," Hermione added.

"At this point, it's not getting fleeced, it's getting fu…
Hmmm!"

Hermione had just gagged Kevin, preventing him from saying the vulgar word that was about to leave his mouth.

"It's quite strange that he came to play with you," Hannah noted shyly.

"Not really," Kevin explained.
"Professor Flitwick spends at least an hour every night in the Ravenclaw Common Room, and he generally talks or participates in board games.
It's his way to ensure that there is no problem in the House, and especially make himself available."

"You're lucky," Hermione sighed.
"McGo is cool and all, but she rarely ever comes in the Common Room.
You always have to run after her in the corridors or go to her office…"

"Same for Professor Prince, but his office door is linked to the Common Room, and you only have to knock to get welcomed in."

"And for Hufflepuffs?" Daphne asked with curiosity, making the two Hufflepuff girls blush, who were not used to talking with other Houses, apart from their quite peculiar group.

"Professor Sprout comes at least once a week in the Greenhouses and…"

"So your Comon Room is in the Greenhouses?" Neville said in amazement.
"Can I come visit?
Cedric always refused!"

Hannah and Susan were scarlet red and did not know what to do with themselves as the Gryffinsor was kneeling in front of them, with pleading eyes.
He was far from the shy Neville they were used to seeing, but apparently, he was way more relaxed with his friends…
A moment's hesitation passed, then the compartment broke out laughing.

It was in this good humour, especially with this promise extracted from the two Hufflepuffs to have access to their Common Room, that they reached King's Cross station.

There, calmly sitting down in a corner of the station, were a few personalities that turned a few heads.
Ladies and Lords Malfoy, Greengrass, Nott, Longbottom, Bones, and the Kemenov matriarch were waiting for their respective heirs, talking among themselves.
Two know "Light" families, and three "Dark" families…

As the small group of compartment 5 of carriage 9 got out, Hannah Abott, Blaise Zabini, and Luna Levgood were dragged by their friends towards the members of the wizarding Nobility.

"Father," Draco started calmly, "I know you already have met Blaise, please allow me to introduce you to Hannah Abott, _Seniorem_ of the Noble and Anctient House Abott, as well as the Heir Luna Lovegood."

"Please to meet you, youngsters," the Malfoy patriarch declared with a slight smile.
"I have heard about you through my son and his friends."

And, under the astounded looks of bystanders, the official presentations continued with each parent, while the families of the three children were approaching incredulously, although a dreamy blonde man was softly smiling.
Hannah's mother, as well as Blaise mother and father, were quite disorientated by the presentations they children were given to such illustrious wizards and witches.

While everyone was talking about Vladmir's future birthday party, Hermione was looking for her parents.
It was the first time the Grangers were late, but Augusta quickly reassured her.

"Don't worry Hermione, they are just a few minutes late because of something unexpected happened."

Indeed, a few moments laters, the Grangers appeared, alongside an unknown man and a young girl who looked around ten years old.

"Who are those people?" Hermione asked with curiousity, pointing to a tall man with sickly traits that stood next to her mother.

"My father," Kevin grew pale as Hermione's mother waved energetically at her only daughter's friends.
She had invited them all for the beginning of the holidays in the Granger's suburban house.
Dr. Jan Granger had been delighted to know the first true friends of her wonderful daughter aside from the magical areas.

"Is that your sister?" Hermione asked, seeing the young girl's blue eyes, which, contrary to her brother's, were warm and curious.

"Yes, Mary-Ann," Kevin nodded, as he thought about the various possible reasons of their presence this day.

"You father and sister, huh?" Draco sniffed, carefully looking at Warren Entwhstle's worn clothes.
"Sorry for saying that, but he looks like Lupin the day after a fool moon."

As they had seen their werewolf professor a few hours after he ahd transformed, they all could tell it was not a pretty sight.

Nearly imediately, as the Muggle looked in panic all around him, he finally saw his son.
The strange sparkled in his eyes immediately made Kevin's friends wary.
Nevill, Hermione, Draco, and Vlamdir stood next to the young Ravenclaw to support him.
In a few strieds, Warren Entwhistle got in front of them, dragging a curious but scared Mary-Ann.
However, a spark of joy brightened her eyes when she saw her brother.

"Kevin…"

"Dad."

The man did not know what to say, and was extremely undeasy, judgin from his slight blush and the way he could not look at his son.
Mrs. Granger kissed her daugher, before joining the other parents, leaving Warren Entwhistle to face the Alliance.

"I… I'd like…"

"Kevin stayed silent, until Mary-Ann slowly approached him and softly pulled on his robes.
The Ravenclaw turned away from his father and kneeled in front of his sister.

"Did you make butterflies appear again?" he asked softly.
Mary-Ann simply nodded shyly, before handing him a parchment letter.
The torn Hogwarts seal was easily identifiable.

"You didn't tell us your sister was a witch," Hermione smiled.

Warren, ignored by everyone, seemed close to apoplexy while they all congratulated the young girl for her gifts.
The second witch in the Entwhistle family.

"You… I…"

Kevin gave him a sharp look, and gestured for Neville and Vlad to follow hil.
At the same time, Draco and Hermione distracted the young girl while the three wizards got the father further away.

"Did you hurt her?" Kevin suddenly growled.

"What? No!"

"Did Gordon approach her?"

"No," Warren whispered.
"Listne Kevin, I am…"

"I don't care about your apologies, dad.
I never truly was your son, too 'weird', 'queer'…
'The lonely Doncaster brainiac', if I remember correctly.
Unstruprisingly, my wonderful older brothers have always imitated their brilliant father.
The only one who accepted me was Mary-Ann.
So I won't repeat myself again…
Did someone hurt my little sister?"

Neither Vlamdir nor Neville reacted.
They knew that life at the Entwhistles was not good, but to see the father and son so distant was painful, especially since neither of them really knew their fathers.

"No," the Muggle eventually said.
"Listen, I'd like to a…"

"Shut up!"

The typical Parsletongue hiss made Warren jump, while some wizards and witcehs around them imperceptibly walked away, uneasy at the whirling magic.

"Don't even think about saying 'sorry', or 'I apologize'!
You…"

"Kevin, calm down, you're about to lose control of your magic," Neville said softly, putting a hand on his shoulder.

`Breathe, brother`, Vladmir hissed softly.
The Ravenclaw obeyed and breathed in deeply.
When he opened his eyes again, his eyes were ice-cold.

"He went to the right school," Lucius sniggered, observing from the argument between the two Entwhistle from the corner of his eye, while Hermione and Draco led Mary-Ann in a visit of the Hogwarts-Express.

"What were you saying dear?"

Katya had not listened to a word her companion had said and gave him an apologetic smile.
Lucius held back his impulse to roll his eyes‑a bit of restraint and manners in public, Merlin‑but he could not help but smile and pointed to the two Entwhistles.

"We could make an honorary Russian out of him," Katya said, discreetly pricking up her ears.

"You have always ignored me, dad!" The Ravenclaw enunciated without any emotion.
"Never a compliment, never any criticism.
Only negligence.
I came here alone for my first year.
You never made the effort to come get me, ask about my gardes.
You were satisfied when McGonagall came to tell you taht I would disappear from the house 10 months out of 12, you were euphoric at the news, and…"

"Kevin…"

"No, shut up!" he repeated.
"You want me to take care of Mary-Ann, don't you?"

"Yes."

"I will do it.
As I have done since her birth.
Now, I'm telling you that I will not come home during the holidays.
I have seen the only person I missed, and especially since I will see here for three quarters of the year starting from now, so…
Farewell!"

And Kevin, without saying any more, turned away from his father to go back to his little sister.

"One more thing," he added while stopping slightly to look daggers at Warren Entwhistle.
"If you let 'Uncle Gordy' approach her, I will know, and I will make sure to kill this man!"

"Why…
Why Gordon?" the man stuttered, looking at his son leave towards his friends.

"Why?" Neville asked calmly while looking intently at Kevin's father.
"I know little about you, Mr. Entwhistle, but I know that Kevin was not happy because neither your nor his brothers ever made any effort…
Even after you learned about his nature."

And Neville went back in turn to get back to the others who joyfully talked, even if all carefully looked at the Muggle, now alone with one of the most dangerous Hgowarts students.

"You never touched Kevin… contrary to his uncle," Vladmir declared.
"If by chance, I meet this infamous… Gordon… I will kill him.
You do not touch a peer of the magical kingdom without consequences."

"A… A peer?" the man stuttred, making vlamdir smile.
A smile that sent shivers down Warren's spine.

"Vlamdir Kemenov, Lord Potter, Prince of the Ancient Magical Kingdom," Vladmir introduced himself with the same terrifying smile.
"Knight-Mage Kevin Entwhistle-Potter is untouchable.
Remember this…"

"One more thing," Vlad declared.
"We will get Mary-Ann on the first of August to get her school supplies."

While Vladmir concluded this charming conversation with Kevin's father, Draco and Hermione laughed when they saw the grimace on Mary-Ann's lips.

"So, what flavour?" Kevin asked, kneeling next to his sister.
She huddled up against her brother and whispered something to him.

"Banana?"

Kevin laughed while explaining to the others that she never liked that fruit.

**"She only speaks to you,"** Vladmir said softly so that Mary-Ann did not understand, while being less scary that Parsletongue.

**"She is pathologically shy with strangers,"** Kevin whispered.
"Hey, Kitten, you will go back home with dad, okay?"

Her eyes, identical to her brothers, met his, and he softly brushed her face as she shook her head.

"Come on kitten, we will see each other on the first day of school, the first of September."

"To tell you the truth, no, we will get you to spend one day of initiaion to the Muggle world," Vladmir smiled, leaning towards Mary-Ann.
"The first of August," he added, seeing her questionning eyes, which immediately turned to a joyful expression.

To the two Ravenclaws' surprise, Mary-Ann timidly kissed Vlad's cheek before running back to her father.

"What…"

"The first of August is her birthday," Kevin smiled.
"You have just given her a magnificant gift.
Since she has learned that magic exists, she has dreamt of accompanying me on Diagon Alley.
She has read all my books on the magical world, even the wizarding etiquette one, that's saying something!"

All laughed, knowing that those books were boring and laborious to read, and thus in they spent their first week of holidays in reative good humour, as they all waited for Peter Pettigrew's trial.
The only bad thing were Vladmir's frequent disappearances.
He was regualarly going to the _Tube_, the _Underground_'s hidout underneath the London Underground.
He hoped to learn more about the precise location of Albus Dumbeldore, but no one knew aything…
No one except Sergei, and therefore Katya.

Thus, despite Vlamdir's repeated absences, the Alliance core was waiting to go to the Grangers' home at the end of the first week of holidays, while planning all they had to do during the rest of the holidays.
Indeed, they were busy this year.
Thye had a trial, as well as the Quidditch World Cup, Vladmir's and Neville's birthady, the day on Diagon Alley with Mary-Ann, and that did not take the numerous invitations at the Bones's, the Notts's and various other friends.

They were all gathered in the playroom of Malfoy Manor's children wing, their residence for those first few days.

"How come we are all invited in so many places?" Neville grumbled, lying down on the carper.
He was not used to participating to society life, especially so varied activities.
He was horrified at the many invitations to tea and even the ball to many personalities of the magical world.
Until now, his false shyness had avoided him a social life with other children, and this escape those events.
He hadn't got a choice any more, as those invitations followed many rules of Pure-Blood etiquette.

"My dear Neville, welcome to the Pure-Blood world," Draco sniggered, perfectly at ease on his seat, Hermione sitting in the comfortable wing chair besides him.

"Does any one know where Vladmir has gone again?" Kevin enventually asked, raising the book that was covering his face, which had allowed him to nap in the middle of the afternoon on the deep green sofa in the room, his familiars curled on his belly.

"Sergei came to take him out a few minutes ago, when you were snoring like a trooper," Draco smiled, before receiving a cushion in the face.

"I do not snore!"

"No!"

Hermione looked up from her book, and slightly smaked her tongue, a noise her friends had lurned to recognise perfectly well, thus avoiding a sterile debate.
Her Stinging Hexes were devastating, and quite painful…

"He must have things to prepare for the trial."

"Or he's tracking Dumbledore," Kevin sighed.

And he was perfectly right, because to say the truth, Vladmir was not in Malfoy manor any more, but in London, along with Sergei.
They had just entered one of the Tube entrances in Piccadilly Circus, wearing Muggle clothes.
As they followed the flow of busy Londoners, they reached the crowded platforms quickly.

**"Where are we goin?"** Vladmir asked, sighing as he pushed a young ma covered in piercings who refused to move, despite Vladmir politely asking.

**"In the tunnels,"** the vampire responded.
**"You will have to do magic."**

Vladmir obeyed and discreetely waved his wand, using the Russian equivalent of the Muggle-repelling charm.
Immediately, all around him started to look everywhere but towards him, and he jumped on the rails.

**"Careful, the central rail is electrified!"**

**"You're telling me only now?"** the wizard grumbled while avoiding said rail, making the vampire laugh mockingly.

They started to slowly walk the dark tunnels, staying close to the walls to avoid getting hit by the metro cars that ran at full speed.
Despite the danger, Vladmir observed the place with curiosity.
Dark, damp, and quite dirty, he could however feel the magic present around.
Among the discoloured graffitis, he could see in some places magical runes carved in the concrete.
And the small being that holed up in the corners were certainly not rats.
The ground under London was full of various magical beasts.

If Vladmir remembered correctly, only one clan lived in the London Underground's tunnels around Piccadilly Circus.
A clan Vladmir was not looking forward to meeting.
As the smell of piss hurt his through, Sergei suddenly took a turn towards a small passage half hidden by cardboard boxes and old tarps.
The scratch marks, five electric blue, parallel lines above the entrance were significant.
Sergei was bringing him in the wolf's den…

"What is a Death-Walker doing on the Wolves of London's territory?" a menacing voice suddenly growled.

"Hi Jack," Sergei smiled, appearing in the light.
"Your guards told you about my presence quite quickly."

"Well, well, well, none other than the St-Petersburg Knyaz…
My wolves tell me about the smallest movements in my tunnels.
What are a vampire and a human doing here?
Unless you are bringing me fresh flesh?" the man asked, sniffing towards Vladmir.

"I'd like to see you try, Riper."

"Showing your teeth, Pup?" the man sniggered, entering the dim artificial light, revealing wild amber eyes and a tawny mane closer to a lion's than a wolf's.

"I assure you you don't want to bite him," Sergei declared.

"Why is that?"

"He is the Prince Potter."

"The _Prince_?"

Jack Riper leaned towards Vladmir, and carefully looked at him, noting hin green eyes and the hair only partially tamed by its length."

"A Potter…
_The_ Potter, the one who survived… with a Russian accent!?"

"Vladmir Vassilievitch Kemenov," he introduced himself.

"Jack iper…
Something tells me you are not the true prince.
You are an alpha, kid, but you do not small like royalty.
However, I don't want to make an enemy of the king by killing one of his highest subjects," Jack added with a rictus.

Vlamdir did not answer, but he mentally laughed.
The King…
Severus would have a stroke when he would tell him that.

"Follow me…"

Two men suddenly appeared behind them, preventing any possibility of escape, and they slowly walked through the tunnel behind Jack.

**"If he is turning his back to you, it means that he does not fear you, right?"** Vladmir asked suspiciously.
And he was not wrong.
Werewolves, especially an Alpha like Jack Riper, the leader of the most powerful pack in Britain, never turned their back to an enemy or a potentially dangerous person.

**"He knows he needs not fear me, unlike Valerius.
And he is probably underestimating you, although he gathered that since you are with me, you are reliable, even if he correctly estimated you."**

**"I still have much to learn on Magical Creatures…"**

**"You never stop learning, Kitten,"** Sergei smiled, affectionately passing a hand in Vladmir's hair, while Jack Riper looked at their every move in the corner of his eyes.
The werewolf knew the vampire well, especially after he had proven to the London vampire clan's leader that he was more powerful than him.
He knew that he would not come for nothing, and he was curious to know the reason for his visit, especially since he was with one of the descendants of the Knight-Mages.

They eventually reached a huge toom under London, as large as a park.
Dozens of makeshift huts were planted in the dedicated place.
Made from hessian, cardboards or corrugated iron, they were small and convoluted, but they had a certain warmth to them.
Several people were standing around a fire, wearing a mix of wizarding and Muggle clothes, and Vlamdir could see laughing children playing with a football.

"Welcome to the Riper pack's village," the werewolf declared before reassuring the group of wolves around a campfire, then a man slightly away from them.
"My right-hand man, Karl."

"Your Beta?" Vlamdir asked, carefully observing the man, who gave out a wild aura not unlike his Alpha's."

Jack looked at the young man sharply, before looking at Sergei.

"Russians accept magical races more readily."

"That's what I've heard," Jack declared, guiding them towards one of the small huts.
"I longely hesitated to bring my pack to another country after werewolf repression laws passed."

Sergei and Vladmir entered and discovered not a hut, but a full-on house.
Despite their pariah status, they had access to enough magic to create wizarding houses.

"The exterior façade is for Muggles in the unlikely event that one of them managed to pass through the confinment runesn" Riper explained, noticing Vlad's attentive gaze.
"They'd think it's a simple homeless encampment."

"Ingenious," Vladmir agreed.

"Tea?"

"With pleasure."

The werewolf quickly prepared the tea, and Vladmir noticed that magic was not only used for their houses, as Jack used a strange instinctive magic to help himself navigate daily life.
As the Russians accepted a cup, the camp's Beta entered and sat down nearby, looking at them with a wild gaze.

"Now, to what do I owe the dubious pleasure of your visit?"

"We want to know the identity of one of Valerius's guests, and to know that we have your support when we will pay him a visit later."

A threatening growl came out of Jack's chest as he showed his teeth, and Vlamdir carefully observed the reaction.
Contrary to Lupin, who did not have any physical manifestation of lycanthropy apart from his amber eyes, Jack Riper and the other wolf, had sharper than average teeth and claws on their hands.

"Why should I know the guests of this Roman asshole?"

"Because, not only you hate him, but also you have his closely watched by the House Elves he employs."

"And why would I give you this information?"

"Because of one those guests probably is Albus Dumbledore."

Jack Riper's reaction was more violent than what Vladmir had expected.
The wolf not only threw the cups and ravaged half the room by a explosion of magic, but he also transformed into a huge wolf, which started to bite and claw at the sofa.
Sergei pushed the young wizard in a corner and stood in front of him, protecting him.

**"Why is the trasformation dfferent?"** Vladmir suddently asked, fascinated by the wolf's natural aspect, far from the unnarutal beast they had seen in Hogwarts.
**"And especially, how is it possible outside the full moon?"**

**"He comes from a line.
He has learned to accept his wolf a long time ago…
Shit!"**

The fact that they had talked had caught the attention of the Magical Creature who approached them, growling.
Sergei prepared to jump, but the wolf suddenly stopped a metre away from them and curiously sniffed the air before sitting down and tilted his head to the side, silent.

**'What…"***

"Alpha…"

The man Jack had named Karl, who has stayed put until then, motioned for the two guests to not move and started to carefully approached his leader.

"Alpha?"

But Jack ignored him and crawled slightly yowards Vladmir.
Sergei, understanding that he did not mean any harm, let his approach the young wizard.
The wolf, who was as high as Vladmir's shoulder, sniffed the young Russian's clothes before taking back his human form.

"Alpha?" his right-hand wolf repeated again.

"It's alright Karl," the leader of the pack answered with a sore voice.
"Take care of the furniture."

The pack's Beta nodded and made a spectacular usage of wandless magic to repair the furniture.
Jack striaghtened up and grimaced as he saw his tattered clothes.
He groaned in displeasure and went to another room of the home, leaving two surprised Russians behind him.

"What happened?" Vladmir eventually asked.
