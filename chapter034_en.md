## Chapter 34: Manhunt

Katya was standing next to Sergeir in one of the most incredible places of the magical world.
She was wearing a stately outfit, and was the perfect image of pride and of the old wizarding nobility.

They were in the main grotto of the underworld to attend a rare and impressive ceremony.
Her heir and nephew becoming the first Friend of the Goblin Nation in two hundred years was not happening every day indeed.

July had gone quickly.
Vladmir's friends were invited during the first two weeks of holidays to attend the great summer flightracing event.
It happened in Spain this year, and they slep on a villa belonging to the Longbottom in Asturias.
They could celebrate Vladmir's third place finish, tied with Charlie Weasley.
After the rest, they had started bac work.
The small missions for the Mirage Court had gone one after the other, and Katya had been overwhelmed preparing Albus Dumbledore's trial.
She did not want chance to have any place, and she made sure she would bring him down as much as possible and eject him from his position as Hogwarts Headmaster.
His lack of reaction when Vladmir's curse triggered was not good for his reputation... especially when he had reproached him for letting a Dark Mage in the school afterwards.

Contrary to common preconceptions, the Goblin world was green.
Incredibly greening in fact.
Plants were all over, looking like huge phosphorescent tree ferns, clinging to rocks and stalagmites, planted on balconies and the small terrasses.

Houses, mainly built out of curves, did not rise more than a few floors.
Only rare buildings reserved to public institutions rose over them all.
Wizards and witches did not imagine that Goblins could have schools, large commercial spaces, or even a comprehensive administrative system.

'Not even counting the impressive military complexes,' Katya tought as she observed the large base slightly recluded from the Goblin city, with its architecture radically different from the other houses.
And to say that Goblin military service was twenty years long...
Some wizards and witches should learn discipline with them...

She focused back once more on the large terrace of the Hobgolbin Klorgin Folblang.
Vladmir was standing there, along with the Lord of England, and all the other Lords of Goblin society.

Her young heir was calmly talking with the eleven leaders of the underworld.
THe ceremony was quite private, and Vladmir had been presented for a few minutes to the whole Goblin nation.
Thousands of magical creatures had seen him at their leaders' sides, and the new had quickly spread through this race of warriors and artisans so discriminiated against by wizards.
