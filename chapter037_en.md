# Chapter 37: Innocent

Draco, Kevin and Vlamdir had just finished their Runes lesson.
They found this subject fascinating, and they had acquired all the necessary basics.
Relentless work since the start of the year had given them the level of fourth years, to Professor's Babbling's great suprise and utmost pleasure.

Indeed, while the first two years of the Study of Ancient Runes class was normally only theoretical study, the amicable professor had caught them composing a simple but functional runes circle.
Which was not normally possible before the sixth year at Hogwarts.

This ancient form of magic, mainly used for defensive protections of buildingsn and the consolidation of spells for the long term, usually required a long study of runes and linking techiques before it could be used.
To discover that some new students were natually talented in this discipline enchanted her deeply.
Since then, Professor Babbling gave them the same homework as the others, but they would be marked on additional practical work, not the theoretical ones.

"Hi everyone!"

"Where is Hermione?" Draco asked, surprised to see Neville join them, alone."

"Here!
We have our group project now?"

Neville, who was about to answer, froze, before frowning as he saw her turn a corner, panting.

"How do you do that?" he asked.

"Do what?" she asked, reaching them.

"You were right behind me, and the next moment, you're turning the corner!"

"You're wrong," she said.
"I left you right after the DADA class to fetch my book."

Neville did not answer, looking suspiciously at the young girl.
She had never been a good liar...

"Let's go, we'll be late!"

And Hermione went to the classroom for their group work, avoiding her friend's interrogations.
Each research group had been given a space that they could use how they pleased.
They could event prepare Potions, as long as they warned their advisor!
With Professor Prince's help, they then put up specific protections.

The other members were already waiting for them, and they entered their own room, as was signaled by their names on a wooden pannel and the password asked by the doorknob.

"It's still as strange to me that we come here," Kevin sighed, throwing his bag on the table.

"What's so strange about it?" Hannah Abbot asked, putting her gear down more delicately.

"The other years, we mainly met each other at the library," Nevile answered, discreetly kicking his friend under the table for the slip.

Kevin help back a grimace, as Theo and Susan joined them with a flagrant lack of motivation.

It had been two weeks since they had started meeting for the group project...

Two weeks they were looking for a subject...

Two weeks that they argued, defending their proposals...

Two weeks that Theodore, Susan and Hannah felt excluded in the middle of the small group.

One had to be properly blind to miss the bond that the other five students shared, or at least simple minds, like some Slytherins Draco knew.
But it was not Theo's case, greatest observer in the school per Draco's words, not Susan's, who was used to seeing the truth under false prentences since childhood, nor even Hannah's whose shyness was balanced by a great analytical sense.

It was thus easy for them to understand that, if the small band seemed like mere friends at first glance, they were as close as a family in reality.

"You go to the Library since Professor McGonagall dissolved you club, right?" Theo asked, looking at Kevin get a pile of parchments out.

Curious, he took a paper and started at the incredibly regular calligraphied handwriting.

"Indeed," Draco nodded.
"How do you know?"

"You're speaking to The Slytherin Gossip," Theo simply said, still loooking at the Kevin's handwriting.

"That's pretty derogatory," Vlamdir intervened, entering the classwith Hermione
He immediately spotted that his favourite spot was free, and went to sit on the window sill.
Hermione, who wanted the same spot, slightly pused her legs to sit leaning on the window.

Susan and Theo looked at each other.
None of the Alliance members tried to show the restraint they had manifested until then.

"Are you alright Hannah?" Neville asked, letting his real personality show under the shy Gryffindor mask.
Indeed, as the two members of the Five Families had spotted, all the Alliance had decided to play pretend.
They would spend the whole year with them, way closer than any other student.
Their out-of-school activities were still secret, but not the signs of their close friendship.

The young blonde girl blushed at both Neville's question and his new calm and comforting aurat, but simply nodded.

"Not really," Theo said.
"She has gotten unpleasant remarks.
What's this quill?"

"A dip pen, the ancestor of Muggle ballpoint pen.
It has quite the advantage over quills, if you want my opinion!
No need to cut the tip, and the ink store is way better," Kevin answered, dipping his pen in the black ink.
"Professor Selwyn approved of it, mind you.
What do you mean by 'unpleasant remarks', Hannah?"

The sudden change of subject seemed to shock the thre Guests, as the Alliance core had gotten to nickname them.

"Did yo uget trouble?" Susan was surprised.
"Why didn't you tell me?"

"Some...
Some say you are together because you are Neville's friends.
And since Vladmir is here, they wanted to put the Five Families together...
Bones, Potter, and Nott.
Professor Prince is our advisor as well...
They say...
They say I'm here as...
As a stand-in," the young girl sniffled.

She tried hard to hold back tears, hardly taking these ugly remarks.

"Who?"

Hannah jumped when Hermione asked firmly.
They kind of voice oozing calm and comforting authority.
The young Muggle-Born had not stopped reading her book, like she was uninterested, but it was evident she was waiting for an answer.

"What?"

"Who told you that?" Hermione repeated, finally looking at Hannah.

Neither Susan, nor Hannah, nor even Theo could have imagined that her face could show that perfect of a coldness mask, worthy of any Pure-Blood.
Theo had a quick thought and did not miss the occasion to say it out loud.

"You know Professor Lupin thinks he knows your blood status?"

Theodore saw the brief spark of amusement in her eyes.
Hermione did not need to ask to know that the new Defence against Dark Arts professor thought she was a Pure-Blood.

"Same for Kevin."

Theo raised a surprised eyebrow and looked at the Ravenclaw, who gave him a deeply mocking smile.

"Seems like the star presenter of Slyther Radio doesn't know everything!"

Theo smiled back, appreciating this nickname way better than the 'Slytherin Gossip' one, before looking back at Hannah.

"So, who is it?"

"Weasley...
Justin as well...
And Parkinson..."

"Don't listen to them, they're all idiots," Hermione grumbled.
She had had quite the argument with Ronald Weasley on Divination the day after the start of the year, and she was still ruminating over the words he had told her.

"If you want my opinion, Hannah, I think jealously is really ugly," Vlad sniggered, making Hermione laugh out loud and Draco have an amused expression on his face.

"I'm doing to tell you the truth," the Russian continued more seriously.
"Yes, we are together because we are the first group of official friends across House borders that Hogwarts has known for the last two centuries.
Indeed, Susan and Theo are members of the Five Families, and it's likely that the Board of Governors wanted to mend the relationships that were thin for centuries.
But you are not a third wheel.
You are here because you are Susan's best friend.
As you might have noticed, we are all united, and while Theos knew us before, Susan would be alone without you."

"Friendship is sacred for wizards and witches," Kevin softly said, his head on his Potions homework.
"If you look closely, every member of the groups have at least a friend with them, at the very least an acquaintance.
They are not crazy enough to put us alone in the bear pit."

Once more, the Ravenclaw had the attention of the three Guests.

"I never realised that it was this much..." Susan whispere.
"Are you sure that...?"

Kevin raised his head and the look he gave them was deeply sarcastic.

"I am Muggle-Born indeed.
I also have the same knowledge of the magical world as any native, but Selwyn did not tell Lupin about Hermione and myself.
The bets are on about when he'll find out."

"Bets?"

"Come one Suze!
The Weasley brothers are real geniouses of organised crime," Theo said, rolling his eyes.
"All the Slytherins know that you need to ask them to have the bets and odds."

"I thought you needed to see Diggory?" Hannah whispered.

"Diggory is only their intermediaries in Hufflepuff, like they have a Slytherin and Ravenclaw in their sleeve.
I would event be they have a contact among staff."

Vlamdir, turned towards the window, smiled as he remembered the face Cedric Diggory, honorable Hufflepuff respected by his whole House, had made when he had discovered the Alliance's identity, and especially Professor Prince's presence among them.

One had to admit that he did not arrive on a good day...
Severus had left in a hurry from Salazar's Laboratories, only wearing darted trousers and an old shirt stained by manual labour, pestering against the presence of a sleeping Basilisk around his potion.
He had given Cedric a vague look, mumbled 'welcome to the Alliance', before grabbing Kevin and the twins.
The first seemed to be required to move Sasssly off, and the others to finish their Canary Cream potion.
Severus had had enough with the small peeps around the Weasley twins' cauldron.

To say that Cedric was shocked by the Professor's appearance, so far from the impressive dungeons bat and his infamous cape, as well as his attitude, was quite the understatement.

But once surprise wore off, Cedric was an excellent asset to the small group, the perfect intermediary for the twins.
Fred and George were still hesitating whether to introduce Lee Jordan, their best friend and accomplice from Gryffindor, worried about his reaction on secrets, as well as Marius Flint, Marcus's younger brother, who was their Slytherin accomplice.

"How about we go back to our project?" Draco asked, bringing everyone out of their thoughts.

"Good idea..." Kevin said, pulling a new parchment from the pile of books in front of him.
"Professor Prince told us we had until the end of the week to give him our subject.
Fortunately, we only have two choices left!"

"I like Hermione's idea," Hannah said in a quiet voice.
"I mean...
Since Kevin and her have the knowledge, it would be like we were all Pure-Bloods.
And according to Kevin, magical creatures are not in the syllabus of wizarding initiation this year."

"That's quite the heavy work," Draco said, reading the proposals again.

"Writing a book presenting the main sentient magical creatures interacting with wizards and witches", was Hermione's proposal.

"Report on the distinction between Dark Magic and Light Magic," was Theo's.

"The sencond one is pretty sensitive, even if Harry Potter the Boy-Who-Lived is the one presenting it.
Ouch!"

Kevin brushed the back of his head after Vladmir slapped it sneakily.
The topic of his status as a saviour was also sensitive?

"I like the second one better," the Russian declared.
"But the first one would also be very interesting.

"Eventually, they voted, and to their horror, Hermione, Susan, Neville, and Hannah chose the first one, while Theo, Vlamdir, Draco, and Kevin chose the second one.

"Come on," Kevin grumbled.
"Not again!"

Finally, Severus was the one to get them out of this conundrum when he went to see them.

"Why do you bother?
Professor Longbottom plans to renew those work groups every year.
Chose a subject and do the other one next year."

They finally agreed to present the subject on Dark magic this year, and started to gather the first ideas.

<hr>

"Finally, it's the weekend," Fred exclaimed, slumping on one the the HQ seats a few hours later.
All the members had received the meeting call thanks to Hermione's charmed Galleons.

"Just sleep..." a blond mass added, collapsing on the twins.

"Oi Luna, we're not..."

"... pillows!" George protested, shaking the young Ravenclaw.
However, nothing could wake up the already sound asleep girl.

"Blimey, does she always fall asleep that fast?" Cedric asked, sitting down on the couch.
The Hufflepuff had just discovered the truth, but he had already fit in perfectly.

"Always, especially when something bothers her," Hermione nodded.
"And always on someone."

Cedric looked as the young Gryffindor girl used a locomotion charm on Luna so that she slept more comfortably.
He then looked at Professor Prince, calmy marking papers on a desk in the Slytherin library.

To learn that, behind Fred and George, with whom he had worked for the last two years, there was a small organisation astounded him.
He had discovered that bets, contraband, but also the discreet but expanding business of paid homework were under the control of Vlamdir Kemenov, and not the twins.

Cedric, a fifth-year, was not the idiot.
Vladmir was the undisputed chief of this small group.
Under his innocent looks, he was a terrifying boy, and the worse part was that all the people around the room knew that...
Cedric rememberd the day after his introduction to the Alliance...
He had seen Kevin smile at a Slytherin student who had called him a Mudblood...
He still shivered at the coldness in his blue eyes, totally opposed to his smile.
The same student had an _accident_ the next week, sending him straight to the Hospital Wing.
And a rumour ran among the Pure-Bloods.
Constantin LLoyd had received a bunch of flowers.
It was composed of willow branches, symbol of grief, foxglove flowers, a lethal posion, and gladiolus, a sign a assured death, and the message could not be any clearer.
The sender was eveident for him...

In reality, Cedric was admirative of the organisation the teen group managed to start.
When most worried for Quidditch, the House Cup, or the classes, they had imposed a structure, whose revenues were impressive inside a school.
All had a role to play.

The Hufflepuff looked at the impressive tapestry representing the Alliance.
He had laughed when he had discovered that his totem animal was a dog, symbol of loyalty, while he wondered why some symbols seemed familiar.

He had also managed to associate each member to each animal on the tapestry, but he still hesitated between the crow, the snake and the salamander for Severus Prince, Kevin, and Vlamdir.
As for the sheep, he had no idea.
They had not introduced him to the last member, someone called André.

"Kevin, could you go see Ronald Weasley later?"
