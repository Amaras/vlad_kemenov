# Chapter 45: Trials and Meetings

Cornelius Fudge was standing in front of his office's window, observing the business in the large Atrium, the official entrance to the Ministry for Magic.
He had aksed to not be disturbed for an hour, and he had taken the opportunity to get a glass of this excellent fifty-year-old Firewhiskey he had hidden in his desk.
He was sipping this little wonder, leaning against the frame, thinking about the latest changes the British magical world had felt those past few years, and they were not insignificant.

Contrary to appearances, Cornelius Fudge was not an idiot.
A moron even less so, and neither was he a vulgar puppet.
Slytherin, former Head Boy, Head of the Department of International Cooperation…
It just so happened that because of his appearance, most people in his political entourage forgot he had not gotten to be Miister for Magic just by smiling stupidly.

Cornelius had an unattractive figure, which he used to lower his opponents' distrust.
It was, from his point of you, one of the biggest achievements of his carreer.
To make the wizarding world that he was weak, a simple puppet stringed by Dumbeldore, Malfoy, Avery, Diggory…
To think that Dumbledore had been Headmaster of Hogwarts and had personally named his as Prefect, it showed he had been senile for a long time.
To think that Avery junior had been in his year in Slytherin, it was probably the inbreeding…

The man was particularly proud of this meticulous work, this huge political farce he had created.
Each of his public appearances, each of his mistakes had been carefully calculated.
His stutter during the ministerial cocktail receptions?
A bad joke.
His clothing faux-pas? An amusing farce.
His lack of knowledge of Pure-Blood etiquette?
Self-deprecation, because who remembered that the blood of the Fudges was as pure as the Malfoy's?
No one.
Who remembered that Mathilda Fudge had been one of the first witches to be the head of a Departement of the Ministry?
No one.
Who had realized that Cornelius Fudge was a master manipulator?
No one.

Cornelius sipped another mouthful of Whiskey and smiled.
Not the usual idiotic smile he usually gave off, but a mocking and satisfied smile as he thought about the last few years and the changes that had happened.

Dumbeldore had been spectacularly throw out buy yhe Kemenov family.
He had not even had to meddle by leaving a few damning evidence!
The old fool had sunk himself on his own, by messing with more dangerous poeple than he was.
The Kemenovs had managed in two year what he had been preparing for five years, but the old fool must be senile to try to hurt a clan as powerful as the heirs of the Tsars, the clan whose matriatch had been one of the most influent members of the Ex-USSR Ministry, a former famous Auror, as well as a Dark Mage…
The Kemenovs had dragged him in the must before they had time to sayd _dzorovi_

Malfoy had withdrawn from large scale manipulations.
He did not know if it was due to the influence of Lady Kemnov, to Narcissa Black's disappearance for the familial equation, or simply because he was fed up with spending little fortunes in bribes, but the end of the Malfoy empire was good for him and his laws.
Even if he no lownger had his unofficial support to make some of them pass, he still had a few aces up his sleeve in the wizarding electorate, especially his latest pseudo-manipulator, Amos Diggory.
Who would have thought that this Hufflepuff was such a gifted politician?
Apparently Hogwart ouses were not so omnipotent…

Finally, apart from Diggory, Cornelius Fudge would mainly rely on the Conservatives' support…
The largest political party in Britain was the majority of his electorate.
He had their support, especially on certain specific issues, like the economy and the rights of Magical Creatures.
Although he slightly doubted the Moderates' loyalty…
In fact, the Conservatives were split between two lines.
The Traditionnalists, mainly old Pure-Blood families, led by Lord Malfoy, and the Moderates, more open on some societal issues, under Theodore Nott's leadership.

Fudge could also count on some members of the Democrats, although they had not liked that he had refused to give a Wizengamot seat to a representative of the Magical Creatures.
Under Lady Prewett's iron fist, the Democrats could become quite dangerous, with some old damilies present in the ranks.

As for the Liberators… he knew that they barely could do a thing.
Mainly composed of the rare Muggle-Borns who stayed in the magical world, quite a few Half-Blood and very rare Pure-Blood wizards like the Weasley family, they had been quite weakened when their leader, Lily Potter, had died.
Well, the Weasleys…
Cornelius was convinved the father was more of a Moderate, despite his unconditional love of Muggles.
The fact that Charles had been at the Saturnalia ball this winter as Heir to the Prewetts was proof that Arthur knew the traditions and applyed them.
Molly Weasley, for herself, was a true Liberator… and crazy according to Fudge.

But what worried Cornelius Fudge the most, and was the reason for is deep thoughts, was that a fourth party was emerging…
Royalists.
Under the leadership of the Five Fmailies, the highest wizarding nobility was discreetly but surely gathering together, creating surprising and dangerous alliances.
To see Malfoys and Longbottoms walking together towards the Five Families, in themselves composed of frankly different families, was more than worrying.
Especially since Harry Potter, or rather Vladmir kemenov, was one of their members.

The Minister for Magic finished is glass and his gaze focused on a small group of teenagers who was at the Atrium entrance, passing the classical wand test, reminding hom of the group of friends that gravitated around him.
Vlamdir Kemenov had a huge power, both magical and political, he would have been a idiot not to relize it.
He was the one leading the Hogwarts band.
He was the one who survived the Red Breath in the middle of the courtroom.
He was the one to start the Wild Hunt in the middle of London the previous year.
He was the one who had allowed for the capture of Peter Pettigrew and had initated the trial, under his aunt's guidance.

Because of this power, Cornelius had decided to let the Boy-Who-Lived alone at first.
He knew what Dumbledore had in mind for the boy.
At least, he suspected it.
To entrust the Hero of Britain to a Muggle family, without any knowledge of the magical world, was an excellent way to make him odlize Dumbeldore and consider him as a mentor when he would be introduced to the magical world.
A way for the Hogwarts Headmaster to ensure both a certain prestige and watch over the child.
Fudge had let him do it, ready to intervine with political minipulations as soon as the child would come back for his school year.

The fact that he happened to be Russian, magically adopted, and above all, fundamentally Dark, had shocked many people, including himself.
Harry Potter, a Dar kMage?
Undeniably… and if he was not so talented in most subjects, Fudge would have wondered why we was not a Slytherin…
Contrary to Dumbledore, after the fiasco during his first meeting with the child, Cornelius Fudge had search for information about his family.
What he had learned had convinced him to let him be.

But now, Vladmir Kemenov was starting to become too important politically, especially since there was a chance that he was the true Prince of the English Magical Kingdom, the descendant of Arthur Pendragon.
Cornelius doubted he wcould make an ally out of him, as he doubted being able to manipulated him.
However, he wanted to avoid making an enemy out of him at all costs.
To be enemies with a member of the Five Families ment being enemies with all, and with all those new Alliances, it would mean the end of his term.
And Cornelius Fudge was ambitious.

Someone softly knocked on the door and the Minister for Magic turned away form the contemplation of the Entry Hall and from his thought.
With a flcik, he made his glass disappear and let his shoulders slightly drop down.

"Come in!" he said with a slightly nasal voice, the one he always used in public.

His secretary, a well-endowed blonde he had hired for his looks rather than her intelligence to prevent her from realizing what really happened in the Minister for Magic's office, gave him a warm smile.

"Vladmir Kemenov, Kevin Entwhistle, Hermione Granger, Draco Malfoy, and Neville Longbottom had arrived, Minister.

"I was only expecting Mister Kemenov," Cornelius declared, frowning.

"Mister Kemenov told me to remind you that you had an appointment with the Prince Potter, and that he could not travel without his suite."

Cornelius pinched his lips and coldly nodded, mentally swearing.
His suite?
What do you mean his suite?
The traditions, traditions so old most had forgotten them, came back to his mind.
As a Prince, Vladmir Kemenov had a right to be accompanied by a princely suite of at most ten people.
It was one of the oldest prerogatives in the English magical worold, as was the prohibition on disowning descendants, or the ability for a woman to pass on the title…
Prerogatives he was unable to abrogate…

"Have them come in," Cornelius Fudge sighed, stepping behind his desk.
While he had invited Vladmir Kemenov to see him, he would never have imagined that he would come a few hours before Pettigrew's trial.
He had rather expected to see him at the Quidditch World Cup's opening ball to meet him.
The child was clever, he had just unsettled him by chossing his terrain…

Vladmir Kemenov was the first to enter the office, an affable smile on his face.
On his right, a few cetimetres away, the young Muggle-Born was standing with a royal-worthy bearing, while Neville Longbottom was on Vlamdir Kemenov's right.
As for the last two, they were standing behind them.

Cornelius carefully looked at the four young wizard and the witch.
He had not realized during the Sturnalia that they were not children any more.
The four boys all were taller than himself, Cornelius noted.
The tallest one was undeniably the young Draco who was probably going to become taller than his already tall father, if he continued growing like that.
The young Granger was way shorter, but the fineness of her features was strangely aristocratic .
Quite far from what he could have imagined when he learned about her status as Muggle-Born, she was quite fitting, holding onto the Malfoy Heir's arm.

And their maturity was strengthened by the traditional wizarding outfits, although the cut of young Entwhistle's outfit was slightly different.
Had he been an actualy idiot, Cornelius Fudge would have stared slack-jawed at the imrpessive tattoo revealed by the lack of sleeve, but he had some restraint…
However, Merlin!
Knight… the Muggle-Born was a magical Knight!

"Tea, Minister?" his secretary asked with a soft voice.

"Please, Britany."

In the corner of his eye, Cornelius saw the slight smile on ther corner of Draco Malfoy's lips, which worried him slightly when he noticed how much they looked alike.
As for the young Lobottom, the soft smile that he showed was his mother's but he looked so much like Frank Longbottom.
What he remembered of neville Longbottom was a short, chubby, shy boy, not the confident teenager who was facing him.
Vlamdir Keenov was looking like all the Potters, bar the lack of glasses, plus a murderous light in his eyes.
This green, identical to the Avada kedavra, was truly cold.
Finally, the young Granger was as suprising as in his memoires.
The young Gryffindor had the same noble bearing and calm as she had shown during the Saturnalia ball at the Longbottoms.

The strength that the small group gave off was terrifying and only reinforced the Minister for Magic's ideas.
Vladmir Kemenov surely was the heir to Artus Pendragon, the last Wizard-King.
He carefully observed how the students placed themselves.
Unsurprisingly, Kemenov was at the center, Hermione to his right, as was appropriate for the only woman in his suite.
However, young Kevin was standing behind him, protectingly.
He was the only one to refuse his seat.

"Thank you Miss," Hermione smiled while accepting Britany's tea.
The secretary answered with another resplendant smile as the four teenagers mentally applauded Hermione.
At first, she had be amicable and compassionate, when they had arrived in front of the secretary's office, offering Britany something most wizards denied her.
Humanity.
As secretary to the Minister, she was for most passing wizards part of the furniture.
Now, she was polite and thankful…
When would they have confidences on the Minister for Magic?

"So, Minister, to what to I owe this invitation?" Vladmir asked calmly, after he had analyzed his tea and was satisfied with the absnece of poison.

"Only to meet with a rising force in the political landscape, Mr. Kemenov."

"I am satisfied to note that you remembered my name," Vlamdir smiled softly, making Fudge tense up slightly.
He had a bad memory of his first meeting with the young Russian, insisting on calling him Harry Potter.
He had been openly insulted by the boy, and could not do anything.
Apparently, the young Russian also remembered…"

"To get back to your statement, I am not a rising force, Minister."

"Call me Cornelius," the latter interrupted good-heartedly.

"As I said, _Minister_ , I do not intervene in politics.
At least in Britain.
I am Russian.
And as a Russian, I stringly advise you to consult you Departement of International Cooperation to avoid any additional diplomatic mistake."

The Minister put his cup down and force himself not to ask what faux-pas he had done.
To his surprise, a soft voice explained.

"Russians never use first names outside of their familial and firend circles," Hermione declared.
"You should read 'International Diplomacy and decorum'."

Cornelius hid his frustrated tic, a slight quiver of his fingers, from getting corrected by a student, especially since he was suppsed to have read this book during his first year as Head of Magical Games.
He wondered if she knew that this book was one of fifteen mendatory reading materials for any new Departement Head in the Ministry for Magic.

"Come on, Mister Kemenov, you are a member of the Five Families and are a citizen of both countries, you cannot let a political role out of the question."

"Until now, being a member of the Five Families was not important," Draco responded, amused.

"Belonging to the Five Families was only a slightly mystical side," Neville noted.

"Until you made a group appearance," Cornelius declared affably.
"And especially now that a Muggle-Born wears _this_."

An identical smile appeared on the lips of the five children in front of him as he pointed to Kevin's impressive tattoo.

"My status had no underlying political status," Kevin sighed, passing he hand in his brown hair.
"It is but a result of the strong friendship that binds us."

Cornelius carefully looked at the group in front of him.
They wuold not meddle in politics, right?
Then, why not drop the hesitation…

"Are you thus not interested by hte throne?"

The faces hardened, as an amused smile appeared on Vladmir's face.
So that was he was here.
The Minister for magic was not a true idiot.
He was a talented manipulator.
But he had just revealed himself.
He must be frankly worried for his position to ask openly…
Katya and the Five Families would be glad to learn that Corneluis Fudge wasnted to keep the power his position gave him.
And Lucius would probably be furious, as he boasted that he was able to discern people's intentions, but was outright fooled by the man.

Vlamdir rose, immediately followed by the others, as the man in front of them opened his eyes wide at the sudden moment.

"It is none of your business, Minister.
Now, if you will please excuse us, we have a trial in less than an hour."

Cornelius Fudge could only agree, and looked the teenagers file out of his office.
Then, he poured himself a new glass of Firewhiskey that gulped down, ignoring that behind the door, Hermione had befriended his secretary.
She had promised to get a drink with her later, and Britany was delighted to have found someone to unberden herself with, not knowing that shd would give so much information on her boss's habits.

However, the Minister for Magic did not see any of that, lost in his thoughts, trying to determine what was the most threatening.
The Royalists and the potential King od Britain, or those five students more frightening that they appeared at first?

<hr>

When time had come, the Alliance met with their parents sitting down, ready for the trial;
Audiance Room 1 was the largest and the most legendary.
It was reserved for exceptional cases, like Dark Mages and traitors like Peter Pettigrew.

The official gallery, which seated the members of the Wizengamot, was already full.
Lucius Malfoys and Augusta Longbottom were seated next to the Five Families, with Damecoles's seat showing both his family's and the Potter's shields.
Only the seats of the the Chief Warlock of the Wizengamot and the Monister for Magic were empty.

Below, slightly over the accused's chair, the court clerks' stand face the stands of the profescution and of the defence.
All around them, stands also welcomed random wizards and witches, journalists, and other curious people.

Vladmir smiled to his friends and left them to go to Katya on the presecution side, accompannied by an impressive Irish Wolfhound.
In a simple gesture, the Russian pet Sirius's head, who yapped in satisfaction, closing his eyes.

"Ready to be exonerated?" Vladmir murmured.
Sirius softly barcked in response, making Katya smile.

"Ladies, Gentlemen, Honorable members of the Wizengamot, please rise for Chief Warlock Amelia Bones and Minister for Magic Cornelius Fudge."

The public rose in unison, and the Wizengamot did so more slowly, as the two most important people in the Ministry for Magic entered.
The the trial really started, on a charge that shocked many people, including Cornelius Fudge.

"We are hearing the case against Peter Pettigrew, who is under the joint complaint from Katya Annapovna Kemenov and Sirius Orion Black."

The crowd protested loudly, while the Minister for Magic was growing drastically paler by the second.
Amelia Bones got the courtroom under control by threatening them with a hearing _in camera_.

"Because Lord Black had not been tried, he can face this court because of the presumption of innocence.
Lord Black?"

Sirius transformed and appeared in the traditional Black family robes, dark grey with a silver and sable shield embroidered on his black.
He seemed to never have lived in the wizarding prison, standing up with the habitual presence of Lord regnants.
Only his face with sharp features and the premature wrinkles revealed he was ever imprisoned.
The Chief Warlock gave the public a second and last warning to get order, even if she perfectly understood the reaction.
She had thought she was hallucinating when Katya had presented her the complaint along with Britain's most wanted fugitive.
Alastor Moody and his young apprentice, Nymphadora Tonks, both on duty that night, had had to be overpowerd by Katya.
When they had heard the Stupefy cast by the witch, they had intervened and had tried to arrest the wizard in the middle of the office of the Head of the Department of Magical Law Enforcement.

"Before all else, as is my right as Peer of the Kingdom, I declare Lady Longbottom as the proxy voice for the Black family for the duraton of this trial," the Azkaban escapee declared with a hoarse and loud voice.

Whispers ran as the Hogwarts Headmistress accepted the new charge on her magic.
Her own seat shone and the Black coat-of-arms appeared beside her own.

"Thank you.
Sirius Orion Black and Katya Annapovna Kemenov-Potter also filed a second complaint against the Ministry for Magic.
The charges are relevant to Sirius Orion Black's imprisonement without a trial."

This time, Amelia had to suspend the trial to get the spectators out, only keeping a few people were selected to stay.
Journalists as well as the close family and friends of the prosecution.
Cornelius Fudge was also threatened with being expulsed, as he yelled to know why he was not informed of this article of indictment.

"You were the Minister at the time and you have, according to the reports, signed all the transfer order to Azkaban for Black!" Amelia Bones thundered, causing a deep silence in the audience room.
"Because of this, you are a suspect in this matter!
So shut up Cornelius!"

Vladmir had a slight smile on his bench.
The Minister had made a big mistake that would probably cost him his position.
And the best thing was that he would not have anything to do to remove this manipulator hiding behind the ridiculous façade he had discovered a few hours earlier.

"Ladies and Gentlement of the court, the complaints are in full in the dossiers that were given to you," Amelia could finally continue after an hour of suspension.
"Aurors, get the accused in!"

As the members of the Wizengamot skimmed the documents, two Aurors entered, framing a balding and trembling man.
Peter Pettigrew was wearing Anti-Animagus shackles that seemed to make him suffer.

It was only when he was sat down and attached to the seat in the middle of the room that the trial proper started.
Aurelius Buldragon, the same solicitor who had masterfully led the trial against Albus Dumbledore, started his opening statements.
With his direct and simple eloquence, he presented the full facts on the _Fdeluis_ Charm that was protecting James Potter's family, Sirius Black's memories serving as proof.
He ended his statement by accusing the Minister for Magic of imprisoning an innocent in Azkaban without allowing him a defence, and of letting a criminal free to avoid a mediatical and political crisis.
Against the Ministry, the prosecution only demanded that Cornelius Fudge resigned and for him to be declared ineligible for lige, as well as immediate release for Sirius Black and compensation for the lost twelve years.
Against Peter Pettigrew, for the death of fifteen people, the murder attempt against two others, and his implication in the Death Eater movement, Arelius Buldragon demanded capital punishement, meaning the Dementors' kiss.

Only two memories were needed to exonerate Sirius, as Katya and him swore an oath that the memories were true.

> "Hey James, can I hold Mini-Prongs while...?"
>
> "Blimey Siri, I never thought you'd be such a soft godfather!" james laughed, holding out the bunch of covers to him.
> Behing him, Albus Dumbledore was straightening his beard, his eyes shining, while he was vividly talking with a firery ginger woman.
>
> Sirius laughed when a small plump hand reached out to pull on a wavy strand of hair.
>
> "I don't understand why he's so fascinated by your hair."
>
> "Well, Jamie, this little one has a good taste, contrary to his father!"
>
> "James, Sirius!"
>
> "Yes, Pretty Lily?" Sirius answered, getting four daggers, from both Lily and her husband.
>
> "If you weren't holding my son, you'd be running across the house with a Bat-Bogey right on your butt," Lily Potter declared with a sadistic smile, while James was giving his best friend a friendly slap on the back.
>
> "Avoid this nickname," he whispered.
> "She is unbearable afterwards."
>
> "Ih, did I just discover why dhe didn't like you in Hogwards?"
> "Because you called her this way every time?" Sirius asked innocently.
>
> "Shut up, Patmol," James sighed.
> "Albus?"
>
> "I have already cast most of the enchantments.
> It is only missing the final formula," the old Hogwarts Headmaster answered, wearing excentric orange robes.
>
> "Well…
> Peter, my boy, would you please move here?" the old wizrd asked, pointing to a runes circle attached to several secondary circles, with dozens of branches seemed to go around the home.
>
> The small man obeyed while Lily, James and Sirius, still holding young Harry, took place in the biggest circle.
> Albus Dumbledore then walked in the last circle and started to whisper magical formula, waving his hand in complex gestures.
> In the middle of the whisperes, the name of Peter Pettigrew could be heard, as well as the address of the Potter Manor in Godric's Hollow.
>
> As the spell was ending, the runes on the ground started to shine, then disappeared one after the other, starting from the outside, then the circles surrounding the six people present.
> The magical writing eventually condensed to form a light ball that flew into Peter's chest.
> He whimpered in pain as he fell to his knees.
> The _Fidelius_ had just been successfully cast by Albus Dumbeldore, with Peter Pettigrew as Secret Keeper.

This first memory, short and full of life, was followed by a second, much darker, one.

> Sirius, pale as death, was looking at the lifeless body of his best friend, not moving in the middle of his drawing room, his body horribly mutilated by Dark Magic curses.
> Judging by the damage around him, the struggle had been quite severe.
> With one swift motion, he got his wand out and bolted to the upper floor, where screams could be heard.
> Harry…
> Lily…
>
> Flying up the stairs, he ran to Harry's room and opened his eyes wide at the scene in front of him.
> The tears he had held back at seeing James's corpse fell down as he saw Lily's immobile body in front of the cot.
> Contrary to James, she did not show any sign of struggle, and he could see she had stodd to protect her son.
>
> "'Mol…
> Mom…
> My…"
>
> "Shush Mini-Prongs, we're gonne go to Auntie Katya in Russia," the wizard sniffed while softly cradling Harry.
> "You're gonna stay with her while I look for a rat."
>
> Without skipping a beat, Sirius climbed down to the ground floor.
> Floo powder and Apparition were impossible in a house under the _Fidelius_ Charm, he thus had to get out of the property.
> Fortunately, he had come with his magical bike…
>
> "Sirius?"
>
> "The man's reflexes were incredible.
> In a single gesture, he slightly turned while protecting Harry, pointing his wand to the huge and hairy newcommer.
>
> "Don't ever do that again, hagrid," Sirius sighed.
> "What are you doing here?"
>
> "Headmaster want'd me to see if ev'rything was alright," Hagrid murmurred.
>
> "No, James… James and Lily…"
> Sirius could not continue and in response to his anguish, Harry started to cry.
> Sirius spent a few minutes to calm him down, while the giant was sniffing while relizing that James and Lily Potter were dead.
> Then, the Head of the Black family made a decision.
>
> "Hagrid, could you take Harry to Albus?
> He must be left with his aunt, as is stated in James's and Lily's wills."
>
> "No problem."
>
> "Take my bike, you'll go faster, and it will be less dangerous than the Knight Bus for a young child," Sirius added, knowing perfectly well the giant's preferential mode of transportation.
>
> A few hours and a few not-quite-legal spells cast later, Sirius had found Peter's trace in the middle of the Muggle London.
> In one motion, he changed his robes into a coat, his all-purpose darted trousers, and he swam in the crowd to find the traitor.
>
> "Follow me, Peter!" Sirius hissed, pointing his wand into his former friend's back to prevent the Muggle from seeing it.
>
> "Sirius… this is not…"
>
> "Shut up," Sirius grumbled.
> "You betrayed James and Lily!
> In the name of Magical Justice and as an Auror, I order you to follow me to the Ministry!"
>
> "Never!
> You will kill me like you killed them, aren't you?" Pettigrew started to scream, getting the attention of passers-by.
>
> Sirius opened his eyes wide, incredulous.
> Peter's behaviour, usually soft and shy, was now completely changed and it surprised him enough for Pettigrew to cast a spell that threw him a good metre away.
>
> "Bastard!" Sirius yelled while avoiding a spell.
> "Fuck, I can't use Magic in front of Muggles!
> Fucking laws!" he added in a lower voice, avoiding another hex.
>
> However, when an Avada Kedavra hit an old man a few metres away, he had to intervene and ran to follow Peter.
> He was about to get to him when he saw him cut a finger while whispering the incantation to a purely Dark Magic spell, which would give him huge power for a spell after a flesh sacrifice.
>
> Don't do it!" Sirius screamed, seeing him smile darkly.
>
> "_Bombarda Maxima_!"
>
> The explosion raze everything in a dozen metres radius to the ground.
> Sirius only survived thanks to a powerful shield, and as the dust was falling back down around him, he recoiled as he saw a wand pointed to his face by one of his colleagues.
>
> "Sirius Orion Black, you are under arrest for the murder of James and Lily Potter.

Finally, he gave a last memory as a gift for the Minister for Magic, very short, but oh so revealing…

> "Black…"
>
> Sirius raised his head, all his muscles screaming in pain.
> The wardens had not been kind to him, as for the Dementors…
> The wizard shivered and huddled against one of his cell's walls as he saw Cornelius Fudge, Minister for Magic since around two months prior, was standing in front of his cell, playing wiht his wand.
>
> "You have killed 116 people in two days.
> You-Know-Who must be proud of you!"
>
> "What… no!" Sirius yelled with his last remaining strength.
>
> "Fortunately, you did not have time to kill their son," Fudge continued.
> "Had he not been a mere Half-Blood, Rubeus Hagrid would have been awarded the Order of Merlin Third Class for having saved the last heir of one of the Five Families.
> However, let me tell you that young Harry has been entrusted to the Dursleys, his maternal family, and you… you will stay here.
> Enjoy the ministerial hospitality.
> After all, you will be fed and accomodated at the state's exepese…
> Persuant to the Magical Laws, Sirius Orion Black, you are sentenced to life in prison."
>
> And Cornelius Fudge left, ignoring Sirius protestation over his innocence, his trial, and Harry's placement.

Angry whispers among the members of the Wizengamot made the Minister for Magic shrink.
He had harmed a Lord of one of the oldest wizarding families in England, blithely breaking a dozen laws.

The defence was minimal.
Apart from the Dark Mark clearly visible on Pettigrew's forearm, the use of _Veritaserum_ made him admit to all his crimes, including a few unexplained deaths during the war.
The man however did not knew why his Master had targetted the Potter family, although it was public knowledge that Auror Potter had already crossed paths with the Dark Lord three times without harm.
According to Pettigrew, Lord Voldemore despised failure, and Potter had been a splinter in his pride, which had led to his death.

When it was time of the Minister for Magic, Cornelius chose to be brave for once and sat down where Pettigrew had been, after he had been put on the accused bench.

Fudge grimaced at the journalists' flashes and faced his colleagues, uneasy at being accused.
He wondered how he had stooped so low when this morning his main worry was how he would influence the Five Families and preparing his speech of the opening Gala at the World Cup, where dozens of foregin Ministers would be.

Fortunately, Cornelius had made the most of the two hours of looking at the evidence to prepare his defence, making his brain work overtime.
He could have called a solicitor, but that would have been admitting to his faults.
By agreing to sit down in this chair, he was showing his good faith.
The only thing was to see whether his talents would be enough.

"Mister Fudge, why did you not give Lord Black a fair trial?" Augusta Longbottom asked.

"According to article 87.4 of the law regarding exceptional trials," Cornelius Fudge declared calmly, "in case of overwhelming evidence in time of war, the sitting Minister can substitude for a tribunal.
Because of the very grave facts, which was the attempt to eradicate one of the Five Families, and undeniable evidence, I have judged Sirius Orion Black was guilty."

"This law has only been used three times since it came into effect.
What proof was enough not to be completed by Veritaseum or a pensive?" Lord Selwyn questionned.

"A magical oath by Albus Dumbledore."

"Do you accept showing us this memory?"

"I do."

Cornelius took the wand he was handed and put it on his temple to extract a silvery filament that he put in a vial.

"I swear on my magic that this memory reflects reality, so be it."

In response, magic shone around Fudge, who was watched by Sirius, furious by the man audacity, Vlamdir, wary and who had understood that the man still had aces up his sleeve, and the Alliance, who were perplexed.
Katya, for her part, suspected that Fudge would putt all blame on Dumbledore.
The man was clever, and it was well known that absent minds forget, especially with the former Hogwarts Headmaster's precedent.

> Cornelius and two Aurors are in Dumbledore's office in Hogwarts.
>
> "Were you the one who cas the _Fidelius_ Charm for the Potters?"
>
> "I am," Dumbledore sighed.
> "I swear on my magic that I put the _Fidelius_ Charm on James and Lily Potter's home.
>
> "Is Sirius Black responsible for the death of James and Lily Potters?"
>
> "He is."
>
> And to prove his point, Albus Dumbledore cast a small _Lumos_, his eyes shining horribly.

**"The fucking bastard,"** Vladmir groaned.

"Son of a bitch!" Sirius swore.

"Gentlemen, please!" Amelia took offence, as whisperes rose up.
"How can the two testimonies, made with a magical oath, can be contradictory?"

"Albus Dumbledore did not really lie," Sirius declared slowly after having asked for permission to speak.
"In a way, I am partially responsible."

"What do you mean, Lord Black?
You have been claiming your innocence today!" Lord Avery yelled.

"Albus Dumbeldore was present when we chose the Secret Keeper.
The _Fidelius_ Charm is very complex and none of us, including Lily, was able to cast it.
We thus asked Albus, who accepted.
James wanted me to be the Keepers, but it was obvious that I would be chosen.
In order to fool everyone, I put Peter forward.
Had I accepted, they might still be alive today…"

Vlamdir clenched his teeth when he saw Fudge's satisfied look.
The man had played his cards well.
Everyone was shocked by Sirius's admission that they had not realized that the Minister for Magic had asked Albus Dumbledore a leading quesiton.
Not 'who was the Secret Keeper', but 'is Sirius Black responsible?'
He was fortunately not the only one to have noticed this.

"Thus you are putting the blame on Dumbledore, but your question was not unambiguous…
You wanted Black in prison!" Severus Prince noted.

"I did," Fudge admitted.
"I was convinced he was guilty, I thus asked a leading question, and since Albus Dumbeldore confirmed…"

"You were judge, jury, and executionner in that case," Augusta Longbottom concluded with disgust.
She finally realized, like many people present, that Cornelius Fudge was a true master of manipulation, as he demonstrated when he turned his attention on Sirius.

"I have made a mistake, I agree, but I would like to know how Mr. Black managed to escape Azkaban.
I am still Minister for Magic, and the prison is an important place for magical justice, you see…"

All gazes turned to Sirius, still under a magical oath.
He sighed deeply before declaring with a monotone voice that he was an Animagus.

"As is Peter Pettrigrew?" the Minister asked with fake surprise.
"Is there a link between your transformations?"

"We learned together during our fourth year," the Lord answered, despite his evident want to stay silent.

"What is the reason for…"

"Objection, irrelevant question!" Mister Buldragon interrupted, astounded by the Minister's audacity.

"Sustained.
We do not have any more question, Mister Fudge," Amelia declared.
"Mister Buldragon?"

The solicitor looked at the two wizards and the witch on the prosecution bench, who shook their heads.
The presecution resting, the full Wizengamot left, apart from the Minister for Magic, and disappeared for a short quarter of an hour, to everyone's surprise.

Sirius, Pettigrew, and Fudge were gathered in the middle of the room to listen to the verdict, the first certain to be exonerated, the second certain to be kissed, and the last completely uncertain.

"Peter Enid Pettigrew, you have been found guilty of being a willing Death Eater and mass murdered.
You are sentenced to be kissed by the Dementors.
You cannot appeal this decision, and your setence will be executed tomorrow morning at Azkaban prison."

The man showed all his will and bravery by breaking out in sobs, collasping to the ground, whispering that he never wanted, that he had been forced, and other pitiful words.
On the order of the court, he was brought directly to Azkaban by the Aurors.

"Sirius Orion Black is declared innocent of all charges brought before this tribunal, however he is found guilty of being an unregistered Animagus," the Chief Warlock of the Wizengamot declared in a firm voice.
"He is thusto be immediately released.
For being an illegal Animagus, the average sentence is 10 years in prison in Azkaban and a fine of 10,000 Galleons.
Because of this reason, the court considers that Sirius Orion Black had served this sentence.
He will be officially registered, and will not be financially compensated.
His Wizengamot seat will stay under Lady Longbottom's tutelage until complementary exams are made by Saint-Mungo midiwizards certifying him to be psychologically fit to seat.
The medical decision will be unappealable, but may be revised every two years."

Sirius laughed out loud in joy despite the obligation to be examnied mentally and physically.
He affectuously embraced Katya, getting a threatening look from Lucius in the stands, to which he responded with a radiant smile, and passed a hand through Vladmir's head, grumbling about his growth spurt.

"Concerning the implication of Cornelius Fudge, Minister for Magic, and because of the current plenary assembly of the Wizengamot, we will immediately proceed with a confidence vote with immediate effect."

Amelia Bones's declaration had the effect of a bomb for the thirty or so spectators.
The journalists, who were all avidly scribbling, froze completely to carefully look at the members of the Wizengamot.
The previous vote of confidence had been triggered by the Minister himself, who had decided, after many difficult votes, to test his Wizengamot.
Ursus Black had been evicted in 1813…

The journalists would have loved a public vote, where each members would be forced to openly show their peers their opinion!
What a wonderful spectacle it would have been, but any vote of confidence was already perfect, so they would not ask for more…

"The question is whether the Wizengamot has confidence in Cornelius Fudge as Minister for Magic," Amelia Bones declared.
"Open the votes!"

After long minutes, the results appeared behind her.
25 had no confidence, 9 had confidence, 6 did not vote.

"Absolute majority," the Chief Warlock declared.
"Cornelius Fudge is not Minister for Magic any more.
An interim Minister for Magic will be chosen in three days in the next plenary session.
A second vote will be organized on the lifetime ineligibilty of Mister Fudgat the members of the Wizengamot.

A second vote will be organized on the lifetime ineligibilty of Mister Fudge.
No recourse is possible for those two votes.
Furthermore, an audit of your private and ministerial accounts will be conducted by the Goblins."

The sudden paleness of Cornelius Fudge was delightful, as Sirius left free for the first time in twelve years and, what was most significant to the journalists, accompanied by what the Daily Prophet had called the Royalist Circle.

<hr>

The rest of the week was calmer for the members of the Alliance.
They had been invited tothe Gangers' the week after the trial for a good reason.
They parents had chosen to leave them far from the mediatic waves that would inevitably follow Sirius's, Fudge's, and Pettigrew's verdict.
They had some peace and quite in Hermione's fully Muggle family.
During this time, the Pure-Bloods got to discover the joys of cinema, bike rides, and shopping in shopping centres, wich Draco and Kevin loved, and which terrified Neville and Vladmir, making Hermione laugh.

They only returned to the magical world two weeks later…
After a small detour through a village in Eastern England to sequester a certain Mary-Ann Entwhistle for not only a week, ubt a full weekend…
Because Draco had managed, with his father's help, to give everyone a surprise.

"You know what, little Butterly?" Kevin asaid, as he held his sister in his lap to avoid her falling at the caracteristically brutalKnight Bus shakes, which transported them to their destination.

"No I don't,"the young girl retorted, wrinkling her little turned-up nose in an adorabble expression which made everyone laugh as they thought that Kevin's little sister would be a heartbreaker among the first years.

"Vladmir and Draco gave us a wonderful gift for your birthday.
We will attend a Quidditch match.
Do you remember the rules?"

Kevin's little sister nodded quickly, stars in her eyes.

"Really?" she yelled, bouncing on her brother's lap, who grimaced in pain before mumbling about fake shy girls.
"You're the best brother!" she added, kissing his cheek.

"Oi, I'm the one who found the gift!" Draco protested.

"I only kiss my brother," Mary-Ann said, sticking her tongue out him, which made Hermione chuckle.

"You're right, ignore him, he's a Slytherin, he always has somehting in the back of his mind, and generally not the most glorious ideas."

"Hermione, you traitor!"

"This year is the World Cup," Vlamdir said, smiling at his friends' idiocies.
"We're getting you to see the first match: England vs. Argentina."

"Will it be like the matches Dad watches on the telly?" the young girl asked, any shyness vanished in the face of the enthousiasm to finally see the magical world.

Her metamorphisis had started this same morning.
To her great joy, Kevin had arrived tearly in the morning with a present, had talked to their father, then had handed it to her, telling her to get dressed and to pack her bag for the week-end.

She had thus prepared a small knapsack before putting on the clothes she had found in the present.
The blue robe was magnificent, cut from a fabric so light she felt like she was touching water.
The wizarding cape was a strange texture and deep grey.
With a flick of her wand, her brother's friend, the one was such an appeasing presence, had tied her hair in a loose bun, then had take a from her own hair a small silvery hair clamp with a green stone.

It was the calm and kind boy, named Neville, who told her that her clothes were made of Muggle slik, her cape was made of Acromentula silk, and the hair clamp in her hair had an emeral on it, making the future witch utterly panick.
She had never worn as luxurious clothes, not had ever dreamed of really seeing them in her life.

The stiff blond boy, Draco, had then explained that they were all affiliated with noble families, and the Neville, Vladmir and himself were future Lords.
They had a certain standing to hold, and Kevin, Hermione and Mary-Ann had to have a certain bearing and a deliberate appearance.

"Especially since we will be in the official stands," Kevin explained.
"And we're attending the opening match, there will be lots of people, and it will be a great show.
And you know what Lil' Butterfly?
I even think Vladmir will fly with the players!"

Mary-Ann, surprised, observed the last one of the group, the one who was slightly scaring her.
He was dark, as dark as Hermione, but she had something different.

"Do you feel my magic?" Vlamdir asked softly, noticing her hestitation.

"You… it's dark…
Like Hermione, but more…"

"Brutal?" Vlad continued as softly.

"Yes.
And why is it so close to my brother's?"

"You are a sensitive," the Russian declared.
"Did you feel something like that at home?"

"Only with Kevin.
And some weird people I saw on the street once or twice.
like what the magic books call auras."

"You feel magic," Neville said with a smile.
"I am sure that with time and experience, you will be able to detect magical natures."

"She is different from you," she pointed to Hermione, who whinced.

"We know, but don't tell any one, okay?" Kevin whispered as a group of wizards wearing the Lawlads Roses, the English team, were boarding the Knight Bus.

"Why?"

"It's a rare gift, and I don't want you to be hurt by people interested in you ponly for it," Kevin murmured, putting his chin on his little sister's hair.

**"She has an impressive talent, are you sure you don't have a magical ancestry?"

**"Why?"** Kevin wondered.

**"You are very powerful for a Muggle-Born, which is anything in itself.
What is most suprising is that your sister is as well."**

**"Are sensitives powerful?"**

**"Always,"** Neville nodded, who was starting to master Russian, thanks to learning spells.

"What language are you speaking?" Mary-Ann wondered.

"Russian, Pap'."

"Pap'.?" Draco finally asked.

"Papillon," both Entwhistles answered in unison.

"She tends to make butterflies appear when she's bored, and it's not a good nickname in English," Kevin laughed.
"She's truly passionate."

"Why are you speaking Russian?"

"Vladmir is Russian, and I often spend a week or two with him in Russia.
So I learned the language, with some magic, it's quite fast."

"Brilliant!
Can I learn?"

"Magic opens lots of doors, Mary-Ann," Hermione smiled.
"Learning languages is but a drop in the ocean.
We're there!"

Immediately, Kevin put his hand on his sister's eyes and whispered to her that it was a surprise and the she would see the staium at the last minute.
The young girl felt herself get down, cross a grass field, then climb up unending stairs, as people were screaming and laughing all around them…

"Welcome to the opening match of the 322nd Quidditch World Cup!" she head, as the crowd around her was screaming in joy.
No one was pressing against her, which surprised her as she had seen in her father's football matches.
Then she remembered Kev' had talked about official stands…

"Ready, Pap'?" Kevin whispered.

She could only nod, and her big brother's soft hand disappeared.
She immediately opened her eyes and screamed in joy and amazement.
She was only a step away from the drop over a stadium that would have made the national football team green with envy.
Reaching out her arm, she opened her eyes wide when she realized that a transparent barrier was protecting her from a lethal fall.

Mary-Ann let her gaze trace the huge stadium that would welcome, if she understood correctly, the World Cup final as well as the opening match.

The place was… magical…
She remembered the three goals in the shape of a lillipop, which were on each end of the oval field.
Although she had imagined the match, she never had thought about the crowd.
Quiddtich was the preferred sport in Britain, but also the most followed in the magical world in general.
And the yells, chants, light flashes as bright as the colours of the rainbow…
Everythig seemed like a fairy tale.

"Look," Kevin whispered, poiting to the field underneath.

She obeyed to see around thirty gorgeous women in the center of the field, inhumanly beautiful and enchanting.

"Who are they?" she asked her brother with curiosity.

"He won't answer," Hermione giggled as Mary-Ann was frowning at not having an answer form him.
"They are Veela, mascots of Bulgaria.
They are able to charm males of all magical races thanks to an ability special to their people.
And there are Bearstorms, for the Japanese team."

"Bears?" the young Entwhistle wondered.

"Japanese people call them _Kumasan_.
They are magical creatures who use lightning," Kevin explained, finally breaking free from the fascination of the Veela.
"Like the Thunderbirds of America."

"And there?" Mary-Ann exclaimed.

"Leprechauns.
And out there, they are…"

Mary-Ann, dreamy, carefully listened to Kevin's and his friends' stories.
Then, as the teams were doing an inaugural lap, she opened her eyes wide.

"Now, Ladies and Gentlemen, as is tradtion, please welcome the winners of the Flightracing Charity Race!
They are coming from all around the world, starting from the Romanian champion… Charles Weasley, accompanied by the charming Chinese Seeker, Wu-Zu!
Clap now for Vladmir Kemenov from Russia, and the Bulgarian rising star… Viktor Krum!
And last but not least, a miracle, a Seeker managed to get third place… Edward Parkin and his Argentinian counterpart, Pao Ramirez!"

The five wizards and the wtich flew along the stands at incredible speeds, while large pannels showed their faces.

"But that's…"

"Vladmir," Kevin concluded, laughing out loud.
"He is the wizarding equivalent of a rallye pilot.
And he is good, very good even!"

Mary-Ann, her eyes shining, looked at the wonderful stunts that they were doing before turning to Kevin with hope.

"Can I learn?" she asked solemnly.

"Each House has its team, Pap'," kevin smiled, "but you'll have to wait until your second year to try to get in."

"Not Quidditch big brother, Flightracing."

Kevin opened his eyes then started laughing again, pointing to Vladmir who had just made a quite dangerous aerial brrom exchange with Viktor Krum, making the crowd scream in fear.

"Ask him, but I don't see any reason he would refuse.
I would entrust him with my life without any problem, so if you want to do Flightracing, go ahead Little Butterfly."

"Mary-Ann screamed in joy and jumped into Kevin's arms, thanking him again and again.
For the first time in her life, she would something that she really wanted to
Her brother was the best and her school year would be wonderful.
