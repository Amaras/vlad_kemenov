## Chapter 23: Problems Ahead

Immobile, Vlad was standing in the middle of the second floor corridor, with his eyes closed and breathing calmly.
Behind him, Kevin was as still as his friend, wrinkling his eyelids.
In the middle of it all, Neville was looking at both of them alternatively.
Frowning, he was wating for his friends to move.

"We're awaited for the Halloween feast," the Longbottom heir sighed after a few silent seconds, used to Vlad's paranoid behaviour since the duel.

The weariness from several students, notably Gryffindors and even some Hufflepuffs, displayed against Vlad means he had been given some underhand attacks and numerous insults.
Killer.
Murdered.
Dark mage.
Death Eater.
You-Know-Who's disciple.

While the first terms did not disturb Vladmir at all -- they were completely true after all -- refering to his supposed association with Voldemort was pure and simple suicide for the ones who dared say it out loud.
Vlad had become heinous and did not take the hits, both verbal and physical, as well as he used to.
Instead, he attacked back, and several students had had to got to the hospital wing, a very simple confusion spell allowed him to never be reported.

The young Russian despised everything related to the English Dark Mage.
His friends had learned that, not only had his parents died by Voldemort's hand -- the whole world knew -- but also that his godfather had betrayed them to Voldemort, and that his paternal grandparents had died because of him.
To say it plainly, his whole family had been destroyed during the war.

Charlus Potter, one of the greatest Aurors of his generation, had been attacked on the Diagon Alley during the first war.
Dorea Potter, researcher and gifted mediwtich, had died on the explosion of the previous St Glascott's wizarding hospital.
Anna Kemenov, matriarch of the Russian family and Katya's mother, assassinated a few days before Charlus.
Ian Potter, James's cousin, lawyer...
Before the first war, the Potters still had a dozen members in the main line...
Now only Katya and Vlad remained.

In short, any comparison with Voldemort was enough to make his angry, which his friends understood well enough.
Some more foolhardy students had thus taken the brunt of it, and since then Vladmir was watching the smallest gestures around him.
Fortunately, the fact that most of his aggressors had ended up in the hospital wing was detering most people.
Even if this behaviour was usual for the Russian, Neville did not expect it from Kevin.

"_Come... Comme to me..._"

"_Kev.. You hear that?_"

"[Viens que je te déchire... viens que je t'écorche._]"

"Yeah..."

"Nev?"

"Apart from you?" the Gryffindor slowly answered, now worried.
"No."

"Parsletongue," Kevin hissed, prompting Neville to raise an eyebrow at the reptilian intonations he gave off.

"What are you talking about?" he groaned.

"This voice...
I hear it before," Vlad said, opening his eyes.

Sasha came out from his sleeve and slithered to netsle in his neck.

"This time where you were avoiding Lockhart and heard something talking about death?"
Kevin whispered, his eyes looking over every nook around them.
"This voice that alerted Katya?"

Vladmir only nodded his head slowly, as the voice could be heard once again.

"_A King,_" the small vipered said, sticking out its split tongue.

"A snake?" Neville asked, noting the use of Parsletongue and the intervention of the Russian's familiar.

"A king?" Kevin repeated, pricking up his ear.

"Wait, Kev!" Neville cut them.
"You speak Parsletongue?"

"It's not the question," Vladmir groaned.
"A king...
It's the title of a Basilisk for reptiles."

"A BASILISK?!"

Neville grew pale and observed around him.
All Pure-Bloods knew the mythological and emblematic magical creatures, which included the basilisk, phoenixes, phinxes...
To face a basilisk usually meant death.

_"So hungry... so long..."_

"Vlad!" Kevin whispered, sharply turning his head to the end of the corridor.

"I heard"!

Both boys go their wands out and followed the voice, while Neville swore behind them, imitating them and shighing that he was too young to die.

The voice, increasingly weak, forced them to speed up, but thanks to the exceptional hearing of both Ravenclaws and the small ice viper, they moved quickly and silently, and managed to keep up.

Neville quickly warned the Muggle-born about the lethal properties of the basilisk's eyes, while Vlad cast movement detection spells at every corner.
They carefully but efficiently walked and ended up out of the dungeons and to the entry of the Great Hall.
They all listened carefully, trying to perceive a noise through the cacophony filtering throught the door of the Great Hall, where the Halloween banquet took place.

"This way," Vladmir declared, hearing a hiss.

He climbed a flight of staired, quickly followed by his friends, but he froze, uncertain at the intersection of two corridors.

_"I smell blood... BLOOD!"_

"One dead", Kevin whispered, a knot in his stomach.

Without paying attention to Neville's stupefied looks, they travesed the whole floor, then stopped at the turn of the last corridor.
The two wizards knowing Parsletongue listened carefully, but no sound rose up...

"Are you sure that..."

Vladmir raised his hand to shut him up, and cast one last movement detection charm.
Seeing that nothing moved, they looked in the corner to confirm.
They slowly walked around the bend, adn froze again.

"Look!" Neville exclaimed.

Something was shining eerily under the light of the torches on the wall in front of them.
The slowly approached.
An entire section of the wall was covered in bloody writing, traced with a clumsy handwriting, while the floor was covered in water, the liquid surface reflecting the flames and the writing.
Something was miserably hanging from a torch on the right of the inscription.

_THE CHAMBER OF SECRETS HAS BEEN OPENED._

_ENNEMIES OF THE HEIR, BEWARE._

While Vladmir and Neville looked at each other grimly, Kevin was kneeling besides the dark form that he had delicately taken down from the torch.
He reached out and delicately brushed the small beast with a tabby fur.

"It's Mrs. Norris," the declared, standing up.
"She's alive, but strangely petrified."

Indeed, Flich's cat was stiff, her eyes wide open and glassy, and she didn't react as Kevin was softly petting her surprisingly soft fur, at least compared to how they usually saw her.

"Vlad, is that blood?" Neville asked, pointing at the writing.

The Russian frowned and brushed his hand on the viscous liquid, before licking his finger.
The salty and bitter taste made his grimace.

"Undeniably," he said, before pointing his wand to the gloomy letters and whispering a spell.

"Animal blood," he added.

"Neville, can you detect a trace of magic?"

The young Pure-Blood frowned and took out his wand, whispering several spells.
In a few moments, he knew that no spell was cast in the corridor itself.

"Frankly, we should report that to a professor," Vladmir eventually said.
"Otherwise, it's going to come bite us in the ass."

He had to admit that the context was not the most favourable for him.
If the duel had provoked the weariness of his fellow students, it also had an echo in the British magical community.
Discovering this writing would get him in even more trouble...

_The Daily Prophet_, a newspaper detested by Vladmir but unfortunately the main source of information of the average British wizard, had _'Usage of Dark Magic Authorised in Hogwarts'_ as its main headline the day after the duel.
The details, grossly exagerated, described a violent fight, which could have been fought by the greatest Dark Mages, and which had traumatised the poor spectating students.

Vlad had growled against the rag, which did not evoke the rules of the duel, nor the origins of the duellists, which justified the use of Dark magic.
He had shown the Russian newspaper _The Red Dawn_ to his friends.
Only a small box in the political section talked about the duel.
_'A Clan War Avoided'_ explained in a few lines that the duel had indirectlty saved one of the two illustrious families Kemenov and Fedovir, avoiding a bloody clan war.
Obviously, the Slavic periodical was successful in Ravenclaw, as well as in Slytherin, to Vlad's surprise.
Several students also had subscribed, happy to finally find an impartial magical periodical which covered the political and social news.

However, the article in the _Daily Prophet_ had provoked the arrival of numerous Howlers in the Great Hall.
Vladmir destroyed all the envelopes addressed to him ith a Dark magic spell, to Ravenclaw's relief, however those addressed to the staff were saucy.
The most memorable was the intervention of the school nurse.

Pomona Pomfrey had cause quite a ruckus in the middle of the Ministry for Magic, supported by several Psychomages from St Mungo's.
The Hogwarts' nurse, after appealing to her colleagues in the magical hospital to help her with the emotional crisis of her students, arrived in the entry hall and had screamed at the Ministry.
With a powerful speech, she had explained to the hundred or so wizards and witches present there that not only was Dark magic allowed to Russian citizens, but that it as the Minister and Hogwarts' Headmaster that had authorized a public duel, when the Kemenov family had asked for a duel behind closed doors to avoid trauma in the students.
The next day, _The Daily Prophet_ wrote a detailed article about the meddling of the school and the ministry...

Kevin sighed while observing the wall, pinching his nose.
Indeed, Vlad was going to be accused...

"And for the Basilisk?" he asked without conviction.
"Would they believe us?"

The face the two nobles made told him everything.
The professors would have the opposite reaction.
The last know Parsletongu was Voldemort.
They could even accuse him of Dark magic if they knew he used this magic ability associated with Dark Lords...
They were about to get out of there to warn a professor, when a cacophony rose, echoing on the stone walls.
The banquet was over.

They immediately put their wands back in the holsters, right at the moment when students walked from both extremities of the corridor.

The flow and the conversation immediately stopped when the newcommers noticed the writing on the wall and the frozen corpse of the small cat, next to the student they all were avoiding for the last two weeks.
Unsurprisingly, most reactions could be categorised in two broad sets, like the previous weeks.


Fortunately, like the previous few days a third category manifested itself, and as small as it was, it reassured Vladmir.
Most older Ravenclaws and Slytherins did not seem to take part, and whispered with each other.
They had all discreetly congratulated the Russian on his duellist talents and his knowledge in Dark magic, before thanking him for making them find _the Red Dawn_.

The students, bunting with fear, outrage, anger, did not move to look at the three encircled friends, until a short blonde squeezed through to them.

"Ennemies of the heir, beware...
Frankly, Vlad, how do you always find trouble?" Draco Malfoy laughed as whispers rang out in the corridor due to his sudden intervention.

"You should know, Dray, trouble find me!" the Russian looked falsely offended.

Draco Malfoy, Prince of the Slytherins, had just openly supported Vladmir Kemenov after a year of discreet friendship.
His cold, grey eyes burned with anger as he gave obsene gestures to his pale fellow Slytherins who pointed their fingers at him.

"What is going on here?"

The crows suddenly split to let the caretaker through, but he stopped, horrified when he saw the immobile corpse of his loyal companion.
Slowly, like in slow motion, he turned to Vladmir, who observed him stoically, arms crossed on his torso, his face perfectly neutral.

"You...
Whya did you do to my cat?" he screamed with a shrill voice that made Kevin squirm.
"You killed her!
You murdered Mrs. Norris!
I will kill you, you miserable..."

"Argus!"

The caretaker froze again as he was about to clutch Vladmir's robe's collar, while Vladmir had not moved, looking at the grieving man.

Dumbledore, accompanied by several professors, had just arrived.

Immediately, McGonagall bent over the corpse of the small beast, while the Potions master and the Charms professor sent the students to their dormitories.
Only Hermione did not obey and bravely joined he friends, defying the professors to comment.

The young Muggle-Born place her friendship above rules and conventions.
She and Neville had spent a lot of time defending the young Russian in the Gryffindor commin room, standing in front of insults from all, especially Ronald Weasley.
The two Gryffindors had got isolated from their House, but they tolerated it without batting en eye, thinking their friendship more important than the prejudice of their House.

The small group, weariness shining in their eyes, stood before the Headmaster, unkwoingly being proudly watched by two Heads of House.
Professors Snape and Flitwick appreciated their solidarity, while the Deputy Headmistress pinched her lips, visibly disapointed in her two students' company.

"Gentlemen, Miss Granger, please follow me.
Argus, come."

The caretaker delicately took his petrified cat into his arms and softly petted her fur, whispering soft words to her.
Tears rolled down his chisled cheeks, and he was sniffing sadly.

"Headmaster, if you wish, my office is just nearby," Lockhart intervened.

Albus Dumbledore slowly nodded, refusing to take his eyes off of the few youngsters in front of him.
Questions turned in his head.
The display of Dark Magic from the young Russian, his getting mixed with the young Malfoy...
Was he a future Dark Lord?
The memory of the detection of a Dark Magic spell from the prvious year got back in his min.
Was he responsible for it?
And could it be that those children were responsible for the disappearance of the Philosopher's Stone?
Nicolas had publicly broken their friendship when learning about the gem's disappearance, increasing his decline.
Between them five, still as close despite his best effors, Dumbledore had to admit they would form a fearsome group...

The old wizard froawed, and for the greater good, tried to penetrate Draco Malfoy's mind.
He immediately got in front of thick stone walls, identical to the ones of his family's manor, that he did not try to cross.
The rumours on the defenses of the Malfoy home were frigthening, and if the young Draco was inspired by those...
Turning to Neville Longbottom, he stood in front of a thick gate covered in black thorns dripping in an unhealthy fluid, probably poison, protecting a sublime glass greenhouse.
Dumbledore tried every side, bud he did not dare try the threatening spines, knowing full well that this poison could kill him as surely as any real poison would.
He then tried to search in the young Hermione's Granger mind.
The image of a library made him back off immediately, the memory of the young Kemenov's shields still burned in his mind.
He thus turned to the last, the young Ravenclaw, and projected in his mind.

"GET OUT OF MY MIND IMMEDIATELY!"

Albus was brutally thrown back as Kevin pointed his wand on the Hogwarts' Headmaster.

"Mister Entwhistle, 50 point for aggressing..." the Head of Gryffindor House began, offended.

"Wait, Minerva," the Potions Professor cut her with a silken and threatening voice.
"'Get out'?"

"I may be a Muggle-Born," Kevin responded without lowering his wand or taking his eyes off of Dumbledore, whose face was as pale as his beard.
"But I know the law.
Usage of Legilimency is forbidden on children.
Deduct House points from me for defending my freedom as a magical citizen, and I will sue both the Headmaster and the school."

Severus Snape rose a sarcastic eyebrow towards the Head of Gryffindor, and mentally smiled as he noticed the high port of the two Muggle-Borns.
Did he not know their ancestry, he would swear he was in front of Pure-Blood heirs, both by their manners and their power.
The young Entwhistle's friends had not taken their wand out, but they all stood behind him, confident and slightly threatening.
Judging by his memory og the duel, the Potions Master knew that Kemenov's wand would be in his hand way before his colleagues could do anything.

A threatening mumble in the Goblins' rough language took him out of his thought bubble.
Besides him, Filius was fuming, and the Potions Master knew that only the presence of the pupils prevented him from hollering at the Headmaster.
Legilimency was the worst violation of personal privacy, especially on the students they were tasked with protecting.
Flitwick always took his responsibilities very seriously.

"In Lockhart's office," the Headmaster said, regaining some composure.
The five children obeyed, and entered after the broken down caretaker and the Defence Agains the Dark Arts professor.
Except none of them directly turned their back to the other professors...

"Your wands," Albus continued, reaching out with his hand.

"To know if we cast a specific spell?" Kevin sarcastically asked.
"With all due respect Sir, and know that it has grown very thin, I refuse to give you my wand.
Professor Flitwck?"

"Yes, Mister Entwhistle, I perfectly understand your weariness."

The short Goblin looked daggers at the Headmaster while talking, and took the young boy's wand.
He cast a _pures prior incanta_, showing several second-year spells.
The young Ravenclaw had used Lockhart's wand instead, making his spells undetectable, something only Vlad knew.
The Head of Ravenclaw did the same with the other two students presents where the incident happened, and Vladmir's and Neville's wands visibly alerted Dumbledore.

"Mister Kemenov, you have used three abnormal spells!"

"Becase you consider Dark Magic abnormal, Sir?
I'm Russian."

With this last sentense, Vladmir had just took the wind out of the Headmaster's sails.
As it was clearly explained prior to the duel, the Russian could not be blamed for his use of Dark Magic, as long as it did not endanger his fellow students' lives.
Dumbledore immediately attacked the use of motion detection spells by Neville adn Vladmir.

"We were talking about things concerning only us," Kevin intervened with an innocent smile.

"What..."

"It is about our privacy, Sir, which concerns only us," the young Ravenclaw slowly repeated, as if he was talking to a senile person, a sweet smile on his face.
"It seems you don't know this concept, though.
After all, using Legilimency on your students is the worst possible violation."

Severus Snape, fascinated, observed the young Ravenclaw skillfully put the Headmaster in his place, then the battle of wills between the students and the Headmaster, until...

"Headmaster, I think Mr Flich needs you help," Hermione softly said, pointing at the caretaker who was silently crying, cradling his cat against him.

"She is alive, Mr Flich," Kevin softly said, empathising with the old Squib's grief.

The caretaker raised his head, hope shining in his eyes.
It was enough for Albus Dumbledore to regain sight of his reponsibilities and especially his priorities, and he started to examine the small cat.
He put her down onto one of the classe's desks, and he cast several complex spells.

"It's probably a... nevermind..."

Only Flitwick and Snape saw Kevin looking daggers at the Defence Aginas the Dark Arts professors.
It was enough to shut him up, and to their surprise, they saw Lockhart bow and literally cower in a corner of the room, carefully watched by the Muggle-Born.

"How to you know Mrs. Norris is alive?" Dumbledore enventually asked, standing up.

"Muggle technique," Kevin sarcastially answered.
"Her heart is beating, you can hear her pulse."

"Mr. Entwhistle is right, Argus, she is not dead," the old wizard continued.
"She was petrified, although I don't know how."

"Ask Kemenov!" the caretaker whispered, pointing at Vladmir.
"He's a Dark mage."

"I contest your affirmation," the Russian calmly said in response, tired to have been insulted dor weeks.
"And to answer your questino in advance, Headmaster, we were talking about personal things, and we did not pay attention to our destination, until we arrived in the corridor."

"We immediately checke if Mrs. Norris was alive, and..." Kevin continued.

"... we immediately checked to see if the blood was human, hence the Dark spell..." Neville added.

"... if it had been human blood, the volume was too great to be harmless, and we would have ran to the Great Hall to tell a Professor..." Vladmir agreed.

"... which we were going to do anyway, until the students arrived before we could move," Kevin concluded.

"I think Mister Kemenov and his friends were at the wrong place, at the wrong time," Snape said with a sneer.
He had heard about about the Gemini and their exasperating talent to finish each other's sentences, but the young Longbottom did not seem to be outdone when it came to being a perfect match with the Ravenclaws.

"Furthermore, we know that on a Halloween evening, Mr. Kemenov is not keen on parties."

Dumbledore seemed to think for a few seconds about the declaration of the Head of Ravenclaw, then nodded.
He had been given a heads up that Vladmir would not be in the next day's class for family reasons, and he had learned that we went on his parents' tombs each year for the Day of the Dead, the day after Halloween.

"Innocent until proven guilty," Flitwick assured.

"My cat... I demand a punishment against those... those..."

"Argus, enough," Dumbledore cut him.
"You five can go," he told the students.

The small group did not need to be told twice, and quickly walked out of Lockhart's office.
They hurriedly left the premices, and as Kevin was taking out his secret wand to cast a discretion spell, someone hailed them.

"Wait a moment, young people!"

"Professor Snape, Prfessor Flitwick," Vladmir greeted them, observing the Potions Master approach them, followed by the short Goblin who was jogg to keep up with the large strides of the dark man.

"If you agree to follow us to Professor Flitwick's office..."

Severus Snape's suggestion sounded more like an order, as he observed Neville, who was usually shy, look into his eyes without fear.

"I am sorry sir, but we have not eaten yet, and we were planning on getting to our common room to grab some bite..."

The two professors carefully looked at the small group of students who, like in front of the Headmaster, put up a united front.
A loud gurgling noise suddenly rang out, and Kevin blushed, putting a hand on his stomach.

"I see you keep your priorities straight," Snape with a micro-smile, as Kevin's friends softly mocked him.
"I want to tell you that if you need help with your Occlumency barriers, by office is open to you."

"What..."

"I am not an idiot," Professor Snape cut softly, looking at his Slytherin.
"If Mr. Entwhistle has detected the attack from the Headmaster, one of the best Legilimens of our country, when he did not know the magical world until two years ago, then youmust have secrrets more important than you let out.
Mr. Kemenov knows that you can trust me, as does Professor Flitwick."

The students slowly nodded and were going to walk away, when the Potions Master added something else.

"I am pleasantly surprised to see you openly show your friendship in front of the whole school, Mr. Malfoy.
Your father will be proud of you.
The whole House supports you."

Draco only showed his surprised by slightly opening his eyes more, and he watched his Head of House turn with a theatrical cape flight.

"I tell you, he practiced for months to get this result!" Kevin said.


"I admit it's impressive," Neville exclaimed as the professors were walking away in the corridor, not aware that they still heard them.
Severus Snape sneered, and decided taht he liked Longbottom, despite his legendary incompetence in Potions.

"I think he likes you," Vladmir mocked him, looking at the disappearing dark robes.

You ddi not see him looking dagger during Potions class," Hermione said with a smile.
"Now, what really happened?"

Draco nodded, worried.

"Not here, the Alliance room," Neville whispered, before leading them to a small spiral staircase half hidden behind an armor stand.
They quickly climbed upstairs, and Hermione released the tapestry hiding the exit, after having checked the corridor.

"Well, Hermione, I did not know..."

"... you knew secret passages..."

The five members of the Alliance pivoted synchroneously, their wands pointed towards the Weasley twins, who had just stepped out of the shadows.
However, they did not have their usual smile, but a thoughfull look.

"We need to talk," Fred slowly declared while walking towards them.
"Seriously."

"A magical Vow," Draco immediately replied.

Vladmir slowly nodded, looking at the other three members of the smal group.
They had already discussed the possibility of letting the twins join the Alliance.
They were already entwined in their business, they led the Hogwarts contraband network, after all, so they could learn some more under oath.
Vladmir ad Neville wanted to have the opportunity to know their contacts in the Houses and get intelligence on them.

The twins looked at each other, and asked what kind of oath, which made the three nobles smile.
They were clever.

"I, Frederic Gideon Weasley, swear on my magic that I will never reveal the Alliance's business dealings, nor the names of its members," the first twin whispered, repeating Vladmir's sentence.

"I, George Fabian Weasley, swear on my magic that I will never reveal the Alliance's business dealigs, nor the names of its members," the second said as well.

Neville, smiling, walked close to them and discreetly whispered the location of their secret romm in their ears.

"The Alliance headquarters is located in room 278 of the second floor of the West wing in Hogwarts."

Unders the Weasely twins' stupefied looks, a door appeared in the middle of the corridor.
They did not expect to discover a _Fidelius_-protected place...
Worried to discover that they put their feet in something unknown and surely illegal, or at least more illegal than mere contraband of alcohols in the schools, they followed the small group.
The memebers of the Alliance kept secret enough things that they needed the _Fidelius_ to feel safe.

The rom the Weasley twins discovered was the image of the small band.
Eclectic, surprising.
The furniture was patchy, the colors perfectly matching, despite the wide collection.
The walls were covered with tapestries and huge plans of the school.

One gesture from Kevin invited the twins to sit, while Vladmir got his school robes off to get more at ease, quickly imitated by Neville and Kevin.

"Well, what do you want?" Hermione asked.

Except the twins were staring at Vlamdir's and Neville's marks, the tatoo of their respective Courts perfectly distinct on the pale skin of their forearms.
Fred shivered when he sa the pink skin on his forearm and the scars recent enough to be in relief.
The memory of bones piercing through the skin and the Russian burning himself to limit blodd loss came back to his mind, while George stared into Vladmir's eyes.

"You..."

The twins' gazes passed over the five students around thme.
Hermione, sprawled in an armchair, with Kevin to her right sitting on the armrest, gave them an encouraging smile.
Neville and Vladmir, relaxed, observed their reaction attentively, while Draco, princely, was standing to the lioness' right, leaning of the armchair's back.

"You all know for th Mirage Court..." Fred weakly noted.
It was way bigger than they could ever imagine, and the sudden arrival of Vladmi in their smuggling network now took a whole new dimension.

"Hence the _Fidelius_," George whispered.
"Which means..."

"... that we indirectly work..."

"... for the Mirage Court..."

"Exactly," Valdmir smiled.
"But how do _you_ know?"

"Charlie," the twins answered in unison.
They had discovered their oldest brother's tatoo the previous year, and the dragon tamer explained them its significance after making them swear to keep secret this part of his life.

"Do other people in your family know, apart from Bill?" Vladmir asked.

The two Weasleys shook their heads, surprised of the extent of Vlad's intelligence.
Bill knew his borther belonged to the Mirage Court, as he occasionally worked on common business between Gringott's and the magical Mafia.

"I am a prince of the Russian Court," Vladmir smiled, answering their silent question.
"I know Charlie well, and the Goblins praise Bill deeply, in their own way of course."

"Good...
Do you want to stop business with us?" Kevin asked as the twins realised that Vladmir was more than a simple member and Russian noble.
The saviour of the English wizarding world was a true master of shadows.

"No!"

The twins did not want to become basic civil servants in the Ministry of Magic, as their mother wanted.
They dreamt of creating a joke shop, joining Charlie and Bill in the secret world of the Mirage Court.
They had just not expected to be able to get in this way, and they absolutely did not want to let this opportunity pass.

"Well then, welcome into the Alliance," Hermione smiled.
"But now..."

"Let's get to the serious business," Vladmir declared, leaning towards the two brothers.

"Our sister, Ginny..."

"...is behaving strangely."

"Strangely?" Kevin repeated, encouraging them to elaborate.

"Since the start of the year, she has become way paler, is eating less and less, and is isolating herself," Fred whispered.
"Ron and Percy say it doesn't matter, but she's not our sister any more."

The simple fact that only one of the twins was speaking was a clear proof of their worry, as was the lack of the usual amused shine in their eyes.

"Go on."

Georged looked at Vladmir and sloly sighed.

"Ginny has always been joyful and full of life.
She makes friends easily, and she already know Helena Dikson, a girl from her dormitory.
Except they stopped talking, and Helena said that Ginny was weird since the start of the year.
We thus started to look over her from afar."

"She arrived to tonight's meal very perturbed, nearly crying," Fred finished.

"Just before we discovered the writing," Hermione whispered, pensive.

"So, tell me if I'm wrong," Draco said, sitting down on Hermione's left,"your sister's behaviour drastically changed, and she isolates herself.
Does she keep something new or unusual?
Jewelry, clothes...?"

The twins exchanged sombre glances, and Draco knew he was right.

"Yes, she does, Ginney has a diary on which she writes a lot," George whispered.
"She told us someone gave it to her."

"Who?" Vlad asked.

"She refused to tell us," Fred sighed.

"Draco, Vlad, any idea?" Neville asked them.

"I'll bet my wand it's a possession," Vladmir explained.
"Was the journal the Dark magic artefact Narcissa Malfoy smuggled into the school?"
Draco was asking himself the same question, worried.

"Yes, the diary must be the catalyst.
If we take it from her, she should get better.
The risk is that the new holder could get possessed in turn."

"Fred, George, can you get the journal?"

"Of course," Fred smiled.
"She must let it got at night!"

"What about the stairs?"

"Come one, Mione!
You bet that the stairs will not prevent us from geting into the girls' dormitories," George chuckled, his face going back to its usual expression now that the twins knew other people believed them.

"I prefer not to know what you have done in our dorms," Hermione grumbled.

"You know, Hermione, the girls' dormitories in Slytherin are open to the boys, provided they get one girl's approval."

"Same in Ravenclaw," Kevin smiled.
"Which makes me think that Gryffindors are perverts!"

The twins loudly protested, but they were relieved.
Their own family did not believe them, but them...
This strange, small, united and dangerous group were taking their fears in consideration...

"Guys!
Don't let any bare skin touch the diary, not while we don't know how it took possession of your sister."

The twins nodded at Vladmir's warning, and they were going to leave the room when Kevin called them.
Fred's excellent reflexes honed by years of Quidditch practice allowed him to catch the small cloth bag the Muggle-Born had thrown at him.
A clink of glass rang out, and hen the redhead opened the flap, an amused smile appeared on his lips.
The ingredients Vlad had promised were lined up neatly in perfectly labeled vials.

"Now... what exactly happened in this corridor?" Hermione asked when the twins closed the door behing thme, staring at the three of them.
